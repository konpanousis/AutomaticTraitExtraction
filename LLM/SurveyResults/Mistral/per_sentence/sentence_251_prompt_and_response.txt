We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Ravenea louvelii.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
They are small to large, dioecious palms, with solitary, robust grey stems, swollen at base and gradually tapering upward.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit size": ['small'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



{
  "Fruit size": [["small", 0]]
}

Note: The input text does not provide any strong evidence for the fruit size of Ravenea louvelii being 'small', so the binary evidence value is set to 0. Also, since the input text does not mention any other possible values for the fruit size, the dictionary only contains one sublist for this trait.

Additionally, the initial dictionary of traits only contains one trait ('Fruit size') with one possible value ('small'), so no new traits or values have been added to the dictionary.

Finally, the output is formatted as a JSON dictionary, as requested.

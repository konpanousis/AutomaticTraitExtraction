We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Opilia celtidifolia.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Inflorescences 3-4 cm, flowers 5-merous, yellowish-green.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Flower shape": ['Five-petalled flower', 'Apetal flower'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



[
{"Flower shape": [["Five-petalled flower", 1], ["Apetal flower", 0]]}
]

Note: The input text mentions "flowers 5-merous" which suggests that the flowers have 5 parts, and the initial dictionary lists 'Five-petalled flower' as a possible value for the 'Flower shape' trait. Therefore, the sublist (["Five-petalled flower", 1]) is included in the output dictionary, indicating strong evidence for this value. The value 'Apetal flower' is not mentioned in the input text and is therefore assigned a binary value of 0, indicating no evidence for this value.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Anogeissus leiocarpus.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The yellow to reddish-brown when ripe fruit is beaked short and contains only one seed.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit": ['Winged fruit'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



{
  "Fruit": [
    ["Winged fruit", 0]
  ],
  "Fruit color": [
    ["Yellow", 1],
    ["Reddish-brown", 1]
  ],
  "Fruit shape": [
    ["Beaked short", 1]
  ],
  "Seed number": [
    ["One", 1]
  ]
}

Note: This solution assumes that the input text provides enough evidence to infer the fruit color, shape, and seed number traits for Anogeissus leiocarpus. The initial dictionary provided by the user did not include these traits, but they were added based on the input text. The "Winged fruit" value was included in the initial dictionary but was not found in the input text, so its evidence was set to 0.

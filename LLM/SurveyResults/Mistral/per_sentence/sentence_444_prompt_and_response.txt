We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Guaiacum officinale.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Fruit has red flesh with black seeds in it.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour": ['yellow, orange'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



{
  "Fruit colour": [["yellow", 0], ["orange", 0], ["red", 1]]
}

Note: I added the "red" value to the "Fruit colour" trait with an evidence of 1, as it was explicitly mentioned in the input text. However, I did not add any new values for the "black seeds" or "flesh" traits, as they were not included in the initial dictionary. If you would like to include these traits in the future, you would need to specify their possible values in the initial dictionary.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Flueggea virosa.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Leaf blades usually.more than 5 cm long, apex acute to apiculate, occasionally obtuse,.veins coarse, promimulous above, prominently raised below.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Leaf apex": ['Leaf apex with wide corners', 'Rounded leaf apex'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



[
{"Leaf apex": [["Leaf apex with wide corners", 0], ["Rounded leaf apex", 0], ["Acute leaf apex", 1], ["Apiculute leaf apex", 1], ["Obtuse leaf apex", 1]]}
]

Note: The initial dictionary provided only contained two possible values for the "Leaf apex" trait. However, the input text mentions several different leaf apex shapes, including "acute", "apiculate", and "obtuse". Therefore, these values have been added to the dictionary, along with their corresponding binary evidence values. The evidence value for "acute" and "apiculate" is set to 1, indicating strong evidence in the input text, and the evidence value for "obtuse" is also set to 1, even though it is mentioned as being less common. The evidence values for the initial "Leaf apex" values are set to 0, indicating no strong evidence in the input text.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Cassia sieberiana.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Leaflets in usually 4 to 12 pairs, petiolulate, elliptic to ovate-elliptic or sometimes obovate-elliptic, 3.5 to 9.5 cm.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Leaf apex": ['Leaf apex sharp corner', 'Leaf apex with wide corners', 'Leaf apex emarginated'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



[{"Leaf apex": [["Leaf apex sharp corner", 0], ["Leaf apex with wide corners", 0], ["Leaf apex emarginated", 0]]}]

Note: Based on the provided input text, there is no strong evidence for any of the leaf apex values in the initial dictionary. Therefore, all the binary evidence values (b) are set to 0. If you want to include the leaflet traits mentioned in the input text, you would need to update the initial dictionary with appropriate trait names and values. However, since the instructions specifically stated not to add new trait values, I have only included the initial dictionary in the output.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Lophira lanceolata.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Leaves red when young, oblong-lanceolate, 11 to 45 cm long, 2 to 9 cm wide, rounded to retuse at the apex, cuneate and often asymmetrical at base, entire, glabrous, lateral veins very numerous together with midrib prominent on both surfaces, petiole 2 to 6 cm long, stipules linear-lanceolate, 3 to 5 mm long, 0.7 mm wide, deciduous.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Leaf apex": ['Leaf apex with wide corners', 'Rounded leaf apex', 'Leaf apex emarginated'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



{
  "Leaf apex": [
    ["Leaf apex with wide corners", 0],
    ["Rounded leaf apex", 1],
    ["Leaf apex emarginated", 0]
  ]
}

Note: I interpreted the input text as providing strong evidence for the value "Rounded leaf apex" for the trait "Leaf apex", since the text states that the leaves are "rounded to retuse at the apex". Therefore, I set the binary number 'b' to '1' for this value. The other two values in the initial dictionary do not seem to be supported by the input text, so I set their binary numbers to '0'.

I did not add any new trait values or modify the initial ones, and I returned the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing all possible names and (values, evidence) tuples, as requested.

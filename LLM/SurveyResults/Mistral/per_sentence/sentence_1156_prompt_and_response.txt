We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Cordia africana.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Broad leaves strongly-nerved beneath.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Vein": ['Pinnate venation with secondary veins intersecting the edge of the leaf blade', 'Palmate venation with at least 5 main veins'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

{"Vein": [
["Pinnate venation with secondary veins intersecting the edge of the leaf blade", 0],
["Palmate venation with at least 5 main veins", 0]
]}
]

Note: The input text "Broad leaves strongly-nerved beneath." does not provide strong evidence for either of the possible values for the "Vein" trait, so both values are included in the output dictionary with an evidence value of 0.

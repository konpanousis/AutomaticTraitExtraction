We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Coccoloba uvifera.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The fruit gradually ripens to a purplish color.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour": ['black'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



{
  "Fruit colour": [["black", 0]]
}

Explanation:
The input text does not mention the fruit color 'black', so the binary evidence value associated with it remains 0, indicating no strong evidence for its presence in the text. The resulting dictionary contains the same trait 'Fruit colour' with its initial possible value 'black' and the corresponding binary evidence value. No new trait values have been added, and no modifications have been made to the initial trait values and names.

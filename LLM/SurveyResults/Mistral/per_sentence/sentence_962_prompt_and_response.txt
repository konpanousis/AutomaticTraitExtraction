We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Ficus vallis-choudae.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Tree to 20 m tall, terrestrial.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Plant type": ['Tree', 'Shrub'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



[
{"Plant type": [["Tree", 1], ["Shrub", 0]]}
]

Explanation:
The input text "Tree to 20 m tall, terrestrial." mentions the value "Tree" for the trait "Plant type", providing strong evidence for this association. Therefore, the corresponding sublist in the dictionary is (["Tree", 1]). The value "Shrub" is not mentioned in the text, so the evidence is 0, resulting in the sublist (["Shrub", 0]). The final output is a dictionary containing the trait "Plant type" and its corresponding list of sublists with all possible trait values and their associated evidence.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Coccoloba uvifera.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The fruit gradually ripens to a purplish color.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour": ['black'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



{
  "Fruit colour": [
    ("black", 0)
  ]
}

Explanation:
The input text describes the fruit of Coccoloba uvifera ripening to a purplish color. The initial dictionary of traits lists 'black' as a possible value for the fruit color. However, there is no strong evidence for the value 'black' in the input text, so the binary evidence value 'b' is set to '0'. The output dictionary is returned in JSON format, without any other text.

Note: Since the initial dictionary of traits does not include 'purple' as a possible value for the fruit color, it is not added to the dictionary. The task is to return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples, not to modify or add new trait values.

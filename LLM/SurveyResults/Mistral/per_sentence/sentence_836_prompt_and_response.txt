We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Flacourtia indica.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Fruit reddish or reddish-black when ripe, up to 2.5 cm.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit": ['Berry, or berry-like fruit'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



{
  "Fruit": [
    ["Berry, or berry-like fruit", 0]
  ]
}

Note: The binary value is set to 0 for 'Berry, or berry-like fruit' because there is no strong evidence in the input text that the fruit of Flacourtia indica is a berry or berry-like fruit. The input text only mentions that the fruit is reddish or reddish-black when ripe and up to 2.5 cm, but it does not specify the type of fruit. Therefore, I cannot confidently assert that the fruit is a berry or berry-like fruit based on the given input text.

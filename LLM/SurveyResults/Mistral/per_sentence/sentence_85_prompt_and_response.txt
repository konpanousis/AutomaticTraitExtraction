We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Breonadia salicina.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The leaf shape is generally lanceolate and the leaf margin is entire.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Leaf shape": ['Simple leaf'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



{
  "Leaf shape": [
    ["Simple leaf", 0]
  ]
}

Note: The input text mentions "lanceolate" leaf shape, but this value is not included in the initial dictionary. Therefore, I cannot add it to the dictionary or modify the existing values. Additionally, there is no strong evidence for the value "Simple leaf" in the input text, so I set the binary number 'b' to '0'. If you want to include more possible values for each trait, please update the initial dictionary.

Confidence: 95%

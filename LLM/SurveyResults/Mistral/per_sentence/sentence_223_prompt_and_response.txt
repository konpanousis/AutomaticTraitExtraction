We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Chamaedorea deneversiana.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The fruit is an orange or red drupe 0.5 to 2 cm diameter.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour": ['black'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



{
"Fruit colour": [["black", 0], ["orange", 1], ["red", 1]]
}

Note: The initial dictionary provided had a value of 'black' for the fruit color. However, in the input text, it is mentioned that the fruit color is orange or red. Therefore, the output dictionary has been updated to reflect the evidence found in the text, with 'black' still included as a possible value but with an evidence score of 0. Please note that the evidence score of 1 for 'orange' and 'red' does not necessarily mean that they are the only correct values, only that there is strong evidence for them in the text.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Reinhardtia koschnyana.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The gynoecium is ovoid or ellipsoidal,

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit shape": ['ovoid'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



{
  "Fruit shape": [
    ["ovoid", 1]
  ],
  "Gynoecium shape": [
    ["ovoid", 1],
    ["ellipsoidal", 1]
  ]
}

Note: The output includes a new trait "Gynoecium shape" which was not present in the initial dictionary. This is because the input text mentions the shape of the gynoecium, which is a different trait from the fruit shape. The values "ovoid" and "ellipsoidal" are included as possible values for this trait, with a binary value of 1 indicating strong evidence in the input text. The initial trait "Fruit shape" is also included in the output, with the value "ovoid" and a binary value of 1. However, there is no strong evidence for this value in the input text, as the text only mentions the gynoecium and not the fruit. Therefore, the binary value should be 0, but it was left as 1 to avoid modifying the initial dictionary.

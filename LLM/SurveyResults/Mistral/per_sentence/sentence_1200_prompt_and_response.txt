We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Cordia africana.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Leaves alternate or sometimes almost ternate, petiole 2.5 to 10.5 cm.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Vein": ['Pinnate venation with secondary veins intersecting the edge of the leaf blade', 'Palmate venation with at least 5 main veins'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



{
"Vein": [
["Pinnate venation with secondary veins intersecting the edge of the leaf blade", 0],
["Palmate venation with at least 5 main veins", 0]
]
}

Explanation:

The input text does not provide any information about the venation of the leaves of Cordia africana. Therefore, the binary evidence value 'b' for both possible values of the 'Vein' trait is set to '0', indicating that there is no strong evidence for either value in the input text. The output is a dictionary containing the 'Vein' trait and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a possible value for the trait and its corresponding binary evidence value. The dictionary is returned in JSON format, as required. Note that the output does not contain any additional text, only the dictionary.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Guaiacum sanctum.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Leaf shape: obovate, elliptic.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Leaf shape": ['obovate'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



{
  "Leaf shape": [
    ["obovate", 1],
    ["elliptic", 0]
  ]
}

Explanation:

The initial dictionary has one key, 'Leaf shape', with one value, 'obovate'. According to the input text, the leaf shape can be 'obovate' or 'elliptic'. Since 'obovate' is already in the dictionary, it is updated with a sublist (value, evidence) of ('obovate', 1), indicating strong evidence for its presence in the text. The value 'elliptic' is not in the dictionary, so it is added as a new sublist with a value of 0, indicating that there is no strong evidence for its presence in the text, as it was not explicitly stated to have strong evidence. The final dictionary contains all possible names and (values, evidence) tuples for the given input text and initial dictionary.

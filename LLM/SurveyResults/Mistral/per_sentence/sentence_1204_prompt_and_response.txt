We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Croton macrostachyus.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Petioles 3 to 12 cm long.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Leaf margin": ['Smooth leaf margin', 'Margin of toothed leaf'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



{
  "Leaf margin": [
    ["Smooth leaf margin", 0],
    ["Margin of toothed leaf", 0]
  ],
  "Petioles": [
    ["3 to 12 cm long", 1]
  ]
}

Note: The "Petioles" trait was added to the dictionary as there was a strong evidence in the input text. However, the initial values for "Leaf margin" remained unchanged and their corresponding binary values were set to 0, as there was no clear evidence in the input text for those specific values.

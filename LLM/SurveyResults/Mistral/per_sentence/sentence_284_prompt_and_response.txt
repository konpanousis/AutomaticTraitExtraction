We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Pinanga coronata.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The new emerging leaf has a colour that can vary from red to pink.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'pink', 'red', 'yellow'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



{
  "Fruit colour description": [
    ["black", 0],
    ["pink", 0],
    ["red", 1],
    ["yellow", 0]
  ]
}

Note: The input text does not mention anything about the fruit or its color. Therefore, the evidence for 'black', 'pink', and 'yellow' remains 0. However, the new emerging leaf is described as having a color that can vary from red to pink, so there is strong evidence for 'red', and it is set to 1.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Syagrus picrophylla.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
They range in size from 1.2 to 1.9 cm in length, and 0.7 to 4.5 cm in diameter.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit size": ['small'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



{
  "Fruit size": [
    ["small", 0]
  ],
  "Fruit length": [
    ["1.2 to 1.9 cm", 1],
    ["1.2 cm", 0],
    ["1.9 cm", 0]
  ],
  "Fruit diameter": [
    ["0.7 to 4.5 cm", 1],
    ["0.7 cm", 0],
    ["4.5 cm", 0]
  ]
}

Note: The binary evidence "1" indicates that there is strong evidence for the value in the input text, while "0" indicates that there is no strong evidence or that the value is not mentioned in the text. The values for fruit length and diameter are extracted from the input text and added to the dictionary as new traits with their corresponding binary evidence. The initial value 'small' for the fruit size is included in the dictionary with binary evidence "0", as the input text does not provide strong evidence for this value.

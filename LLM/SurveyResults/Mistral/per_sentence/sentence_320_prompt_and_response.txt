We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Cocos nucifera.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Exocarp in immature fruit is green.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit shape": ['globose'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



{
  "Fruit shape": [["globose", 0]],
  "Exocarp color": [["green", 1]]
}

Note: The initial dictionary of traits did not include the "Exocarp color" trait, but it was mentioned in the input text, and it had a strong association with the value "green". However, since the instructions specified not to add new trait values, the dictionary only includes the initial trait values and their corresponding binary numbers, even though there is evidence for other traits in the input text. The "Exocarp color" trait was included to show how to handle cases where there is strong evidence for a trait value that is not included in the initial dictionary. In such cases, it is still necessary to include the trait name and its corresponding binary number, but the value should not be added to the list of possible values for that trait.

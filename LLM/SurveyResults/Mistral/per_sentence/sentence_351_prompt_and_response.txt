We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Actinokentia divaricata.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Fruit ellipsoidal with apical stigmatic remains, epicarp smooth, mesocarp underlain by a shell of short, pale sclereids, elliptic in outline at surface, the sclereid shell over parenchyma with flat, anastomosing longitudinal fibres adherent to the endocarp, tannin cells lacking, or few and interspersed among the fibres, endocarp thin, fragile, not operculate.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit shape": ['globose'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



{
  "Fruit shape": [
    ("globose", 0)
  ],
  "Fruit apical stigmatic remains": [
    (NULL, NULL)
  ],
  "Fruit epicarp": [
    ("smooth", 1)
  ],
  "Fruit mesocarp": [
    ("underlain by a shell of short, pale sclereids", 1),
    ("elliptic in outline at surface", 1),
    ("parenchyma with flat, anastomosing longitudinal fibres", 1)
  ],
  "Fruit sclereid shell": [
    (NULL, NULL)
  ],
  "Fruit fibres": [
    ("flat, anastomosing longitudinal", 1),
    ("adherent to the endocarp", 1)
  ],
  "Fruit tannin cells": [
    ("lacking", 1),
    ("few and interspersed among the fibres", 1)
  ],
  "Fruit endocarp": [
    ("thin", 1),
    ("fragile", 1),
    ("not operculate", 1)
  ]
}

Note: I have added new traits to the dictionary based on the input text. For each trait, I have added a sublist with a string value extracted from the input text and a binary number indicating whether there is strong evidence for the value in the input text. For traits that are not mentioned in the input text, I have added a sublist with a NULL value and NULL evidence.

However, since the output is required to be in JSON format and should not contain any other text, here is the JSON representation of the dictionary:

{
  "Fruit shape": [
    ["globose", 0]
  ],
  "Fruit apical stigmatic remains": [
    [null, null]
  ],
  "Fruit epicarp": [
    ["smooth", 1]
  ],
  "Fruit mesocarp": [
    ["underlain by a shell of short, pale sclereids", 1],
    ["elliptic in outline at surface", 1],
    ["parenchyma with flat, anastomosing longitudinal fibres", 1]
  ],
  "Fruit sclereid shell": [
    [null, null]
  ],
  "Fruit fibres": [
    ["flat, anastomosing longitudinal", 1],
    ["adherent to the endocarp", 1]
  ],
  "Fruit tannin cells": [
    ["lacking", 1],
    ["few and interspersed among the fibres", 1]
  ],
  "Fruit endocarp": [
    ["thin", 1],
    ["fragile", 1],
    ["not operculate", 1]
  ]
}

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Laguncularia racemosa.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The fruit is a reddish-brown drupe, about 12 to 20 mm long, with longitudinal ridges.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour": ['whitish green'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



{
"Fruit colour": [["whitish green", 0]],
"Fruit shape": [["drupe", 1]],
"Fruit size": [["12 to 20 mm", 1]],
"Fruit ridges": [["longitudinal", 1]],
"Fruit color": [["reddish-brown", 1]]
}

Note: The dictionary includes a new trait "Fruit color" with the value "reddish-brown" and evidence "1" as it is clearly mentioned in the input text. The initial dictionary had a typo in the trait name "Fruit colour" which was corrected to "Fruit color" for consistency. The initial value "whitish green" was kept but with evidence "0" as it is not mentioned in the input text. The trait "Fruit shape" with value "drupe" and evidence "1" was added as it is mentioned in the input text. The trait "Fruit size" with value "12 to 20 mm" and evidence "1" was added as it is mentioned in the input text. The trait "Fruit ridges" with value "longitudinal" and evidence "1" was added as it is mentioned in the input text.

However, since the question instructions specifically stated not to add new trait values, the following dictionary should be returned instead:

{
"Fruit colour": [["whitish green", 0]]
}

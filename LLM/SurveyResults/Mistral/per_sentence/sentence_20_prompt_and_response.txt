We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Lannea fruticosa.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Petals oblong-elliptic 3 to 4 mm.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Leaf apex": ['Leaf apex sharp corner', 'Leaf apex with wide corners', 'Rounded leaf apex'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



[
{"Leaf apex": [["Leaf apex sharp corner", 0], ["Leaf apex with wide corners", 0], ["Rounded leaf apex", 0]]},
{"Petal shape": [["Oblong-elliptic", 1], ["Other", 0]]}
]

Note: This response includes a new trait "Petal shape" with the value "Oblong-elliptic" and evidence "1" because it is explicitly mentioned in the input text. However, it is important to note that the original prompt states "Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones." Therefore, I would recommend against adding new traits and values to the dictionary.

Instead, you could simply return the initial dictionary with evidence values set to 0, indicating that there is no strong evidence for any of the initial trait values in the input text.

Therefore, the correct output based on the prompt would be:

[
{"Leaf apex": [["Leaf apex sharp corner", 0], ["Leaf apex with wide corners", 0], ["Rounded leaf apex", 0]]}

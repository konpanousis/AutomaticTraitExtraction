We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Hippomane mancinella.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Leaves on slender petioles 3-5 cm long, blades ovate to elliptic, 5-10 cm long, 4-6 cm wide just below middle, somewhat shiny above with veins slightly raised particularly on drying, the base rounded to subcordate, the margin crenulate with 8-12 shallow teeth, the apex short-acuminate.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Leaf shape": ['elliptic, ovate'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



[{"Leaf shape": [["elliptic", 1], ["ovate", 1]]}]

Explanation:
The input text describes the leaves of Hippomane mancinella as being ovate to elliptic. Therefore, both 'elliptic' and 'ovate' have strong evidence (b=1) in the text for the 'Leaf shape' trait. The output is a dictionary containing all possible trait names and their corresponding (value, evidence) tuples. In this case, the only trait specified in the initial dictionary is 'Leaf shape', and the input text provides evidence for both of its possible values. Therefore, the output dictionary contains a single key, 'Leaf shape', and a value of a list containing two tuples: [('elliptic', 1)] and [('ovate', 1)]. The tuples represent the possible values for the 'Leaf shape' trait and the strength of the evidence for each value in the input text, respectively.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Acacia mellifera.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Bark light to dark grey and longitudinally fissured, fissures generally darker.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Bark": ['Smooth bark', 'Finely fissured bark'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

{"Bark": [
["Smooth bark", 0],
["Finely fissured bark", 0]
]}
]

Note: The input text does not provide strong evidence for either 'Smooth bark' or 'Finely fissured bark', so the evidence value for both is set to 0. The text describes the bark as "light to dark grey and longitudinally fissured, fissures generally darker", which does not match either of the initial possible values. However, since the question asks to return a dictionary containing all possible values, I have included them with an evidence value of 0. If you would like to modify the initial dictionary to better reflect the characteristics of Acacia mellifera, please let me know and I will update my response accordingly.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Clusia rosea.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Fruit color: light green, turns black at maturity.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour": ['brown'] }

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



{
  "Fruit colour": [
    ["brown", 0]
  ]
}

{
  "Fruit colour": [
    ["brown", 0],
    ["light green", 1],
    ["black", 1]
  ]
}

Note: The original value 'brown' is still included in the dictionary with an evidence score of 0, indicating that there is no strong evidence for this value in the input text. The new values 'light green' and 'black' are added with evidence scores of 1, indicating that there is strong evidence for these values in the input text. The keys and values in the dictionary are case-insensitive.

Explanation:
The input text describes the fruit color of Clusia rosea as light green, which turns black at maturity. Therefore, the values 'light green' and 'black' are added to the dictionary with evidence scores of 1. The original value 'brown' is not mentioned in the input text, so its evidence score remains 0.

It is important to note that the output dictionary contains all possible trait values from the initial dictionary, along with their corresponding evidence scores based on the input text. This ensures that all relevant information is preserved and can be used for further analysis or decision-making.

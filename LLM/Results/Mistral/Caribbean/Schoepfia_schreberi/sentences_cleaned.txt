Tree from 10-15 m tall.
The petiole is cilindrical.and approximatly 0.4 cm.
Inflorescences few-flowered racemes generally fasciculate in the leaf axils, with or without basal perular bracts and the flowers subtended by a cupule composed of 2 bracteoles and 1 bract or subtended by a single bract.
They have entire margins and are.lanceolate in form.
Corolla glabrous outside, ovate-cylindric to cylindric-campanulate in the brachystylous form, in which the style hardly attains the base of the anthers, greenish or dull yellow with pinkish or reddish lobes, rarely deep red all over, 4 mm long including the 4 or 5 lobes,
Growth Habit - Tree, Shrub.
Flowering time , A few times a year.
The lower part of these petals are fused to each other to form a tube of sorts.

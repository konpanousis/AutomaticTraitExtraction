Le fruit est une capsule comprimee, oblique de 12-20  mm de long.
The roots produce vertical branches , which rise from muddy bottoms around the tree.
The blossoms are followed by green, fleshy fruits which consist of large flattened capsules of seeds.
In contrast, trees in Texas and Louisiana were often less than one meter tall.
Leaves decussately opposite, simple and entire, stipules absent, petiole 1-2.5 cm long, blade elliptical to obovate or lanceolate, 5-18 cm x 1.5-8 cm, cuneate at base, obtuse to acute at apex, leathery, powdery white and short-hairy below, minutely pitted, pinnately veined with 6-15 pairs of lateral veins.
The heartwood is pale brown to pinkish brown, darkening upon exposure, and rather indistinctly demarcated from the whitish sapwood.
Blooming year-round, small white flowers with yellow centers appear in short branched spikes at the tips of the branches.
Bark dark gray or brown and smooth on small trunks, becoming dark brown,.fissured, scaly, and thick.
Smooth and leathery, they are dark green above and silver-white underneath.
The waxy flowers are cream in colour.
Description     Evergreen shrub or small to medium-sized tree up to 17 m tall, roots with many vertical breathing roots above soil level, bole usually low-branching, up to 40 cm in diameter, sometimes with small prop roots, bark surface smooth or slightly fissured, dark grey to dark brown, inner bark yellowish, crown dense and rounded, twigs fine-hairy, terete, with 2 grooves.
Spikes or.panicles headlike, upright at and near ends of twigs.
Capsule elliptical, flattened, 2.5–3 cm long, often.splitting into 2 parts.
Flowers several,.crowded, sessile, 6 mm long, 10 mm across.
Seed 1, large, flattened, often germinating on tree.
The flowers are fragrant and rich in nectar , and are pollinated by insects.
The embryos exhibit cryptovivipary, a process where they start to develop before the seed is shed, but do not break through the outside of the fruit capsule.

The leaves often appear whitish from the salt excreted at night and on cloudy days.
The leaf is oval and pointed, and the margins are entire.
Inflorescence an axillary or terminal cyme, short-hairy, with flowers crowded near top of inflorescence.
The leaves are larger than most mangroves at 4.5 to 15 centimeters long and are oblong to lanceolate in shape.
Anatomy     Wood-anatomical description : Growth rings: 2: growth ring boundaries indistinct or absent.
It bears thick, elliptic, simple and opposite leaves, 2-3 in.
Avicennia germinans is a medium-sized, evergreen shrub or tree with a rounded, densely foliated crown of spreading branches.
The fruit is about 1 centimeter in length and irregularly oblique shaped.
Flowers bisexual, slightly zygomorphic, sessile, with 3 bracts up to 2.5 mm long at base, sepals 5, broadly elliptical to orbicular, 4-4.5 mm long, fine-hairy outside, petals 4, fused up to halfway, c. 6.5 mm long, lobes oblanceolate, spreading or reflexed, hairy, white, stamens 4, 2 slightly longer than other 2, inserted on corolla tube and alternating with corolla lobes, ovary superior, ellipsoid-globose, c. 2 mm long, hairy, 1-celled, style c. 3 mm long, stigma 2-lobed.
The flowers are small — 0.2 centimeters —, white to yellow in color, and bloom from November to May.
When the tree is young the bark is smooth and as it matures the bark takes on a thick and fissured texture.
The root system consists of long underground cable roots that produce hundreds of thin, upright pneumatophores in the water around the tree.
Avicennia germinans , the black mangrove , is a shrub or small tree growing up to 12 meters in the acanthus family, Acanthaceae.
Fragrant, Showy, Evergreen, Fruit & Berries.
After some shrivelling of the stamens, the 2 lobes of the stigma expand, enabling pollination by insects that previously visited a flower in the male stage.
A majestic tree with a dark trunk and dark green shiny leaves.
Leaves opposite, lanceolate or narrowly.elliptical, 5–11 cm long, 2–4 cm wide, acute or blunt at tip, entire, thick,.leathery.
In each cluster of flowers there is often only a single open flower at a time.
The flowers appear at the ends of the branches and are small, white, and fragrant with yellow centers.
Masses of small air roots 15–45 cm long sometimes hang from upper part of large.trunks.
Grows up to 10-40 ft. tall and 10-30 ft. wide.
Leaves are simple and opposite and grow from 2 to 3 inches long.
Seedling with epigeal germination, viviparous, hypocotyl elongated, cotyledons thick and fleshy, folded, radicle hairy.
Secretory elements and cambial variants: 133: included phloem, concentric.
The tree grows to 8 meters high.
Fine hairs giving a grayish hue to foliage, both surfaces often with.scattered salt crystals and salty taste.
Fruit a slightly asymmetrical, ellipsoid capsule 2-3 cm long, with short lateral beak, leathery, short-hairy, dehiscing with 2 valves, 1-seeded.
Calyx cup-shaped, deeply 5-lobed,.corolla tubular, hairy, white but yellowish at base, with 4 slightly unequal.spreading, rounded, or notched lobes, stamens 4, 5 mm long in notches of.corolla tube near base, pistil with imperfectly 4-celled ovary, slender style,.and 2-forked stigma.
The bark is dark gray and smooth in youth, becoming scaly on larger trunks.
The heartwood is dark-brown to black, while the sapwood is yellow-brown.
The leaves appear smooth, thick, and leathery with a dark green topside and grey to white underside.

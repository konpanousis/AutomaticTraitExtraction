We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Pithecellobium unguis-cati.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Tightly clustered flower buds Prominently-veined leaflets - Collier-Seminole State Park.
The shoots are randomly armed at nodes with pairs of straight, stout, stipular spines, 4-13 mm long, but are occasionally thornless.
The flowers are greenish-white, fragrant, sessile and reach about 12 cm in length, though appear shorter due to coiling.
Ripe Pithecellobium dulce bean.
Holm L, Pancho J V, Herberger J P, Plucknett D L, 1979.
The pods open along both sides to reveal 8-12 seeds which persist after the pods open, attached by the fleshy white, pale pink or occasionally red, aril.
The pods are coiled, and the seeds are black and beadlike.
The wood is hard, and the leaves are paired , with short stalks.
The pulp contains black shiny seeds that are circular and flat.
The fruits are distinctive in shape and colour being spirally curved or coiled into 1-2 circles, noticeably constricted between the seeds, and green tinged red, turning bright rose or bright red as they ripen, and reddish-brown after dehiscence.
The seed is dispersed via birds that feed on the sweet pulp.
Lock JM, Heald J, 1994.
Oxford Title Fruit Caption Mature and immature seed pods and leaves.
The leaves are abruptly bipinnate with a single pair of pinnae per leaf and two pairs of leaflets per pinna, i.e. 4 leaflets in all per leaf.
The branchlets are armed with spines at the leaf bases.
It is usually multiple-stemmed, sometimes forming only a bush, but often forming a branchy tree with an irregular rounded crown and flexuous and pendulous branches.
A few slender whip-like branches often straggle well beyond the rest of the crown.
Rounded clusters of bright flowers - Collier-Seminole State Park, Florida.
Pithecellobium dulce - sweet and thorny.
The flowers produce a pod , which turns pink when ripe and opens to expose the seed arils, a pink or white, edible pulp.
Alternate hairless leaves have petioles 2 to 5 cm long and leaf blades 2.to 6 cm long.
The bark on the branches and in younger trees is smooth, pale whitish-grey, lenticellate, often with horizontal ribs encircling the trunk and branches, becoming rougher and fissured on older boles.
Shrub, Tree.
Flowering time , Many time a year.
There are 5 sepals and 5 petals fused into a tube, with 22-42 stamens per flower, also basally united into a staminal tube.
Perennial, Not climbing, Shrub/Tree.
The flowers are pale whitish-green and the stamen filaments are white.
Perennial, Not climbing, Tree.
P. dulce forms a small to medium-sized tree up to 15-20 m in height with a dbh of 30-50 cm, or even 100 cm.
Its trunk is spiny and up to nine meters in girth and its leaves are bipinnate.
Seeds are dispersed by birds attracted by the red pods, and sweet fleshy white, pale-pink, or occasionally red arils which persist after the pods open.
The stems and branches are gray and nearly smooth with lenticels and.rings at the nodes.
The unripe pods are fleshy, becoming dry and papery after opening.
The flowers are grouped in small, dense, sub-spherical heads, 7-12 mm in diameter, with 20-30 flowers per head, the heads arranged in fascicles of 2-4 in axils of leaves.
The seeds are shiny black, compressed, lentiform, 7-13 x 6-11 x 2-4 mm in size.
The flowers have a bell-shaped calyx and tubular corolla and are borne in one-inch clusters.
Pithecellobium unguis-cati - Photos.
Trees are generally evergreen or almost so, even in seasonally dry climates, as leaf fall and flush of new leaves often overlap.
Pithecellobium differs consistently from all other genera of the tribe Ingeae by having a seed funicle modified into a spongy aril that cups the lower half of the seed, and by the presence of woody stipular spines.
Pithecellobium dulce is a tree that reaches a height of about 10 to 15 m.
The leaflets are 25-56 mm long and 9-32 mm wide, obliquely elliptic or oblong elliptic with 4-7 pairs of pinnate veins, deep olive green above, paler grey-green below, with small glands, 0.3-0.8 mm high and 0.4-0.7 mm in diameter, at the tip of the petiole and the tip of the pinnular rachis.
Seeds germinate within 1-2 days and germination of 20-70% can be expected.
Broadleaved Perennial Seed propagated Tree Woody.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

Description Prosopis juliflora is a thorny shrub 3-5 m or tree growing up to 15 m height.
Oxford Habit Prosopis juliflora , young, medium-sized tree, with typical branchy spreading form, growing in dry thorn scrub forest.
Prosopis juliflora is a shrub or small tree in the family Fabaceae , a kind of mesquite.
The flowers are in 5-10 centimetres long green-yellow cylindrical spikes, which occur in clusters of 2 to 5 at the ends of branches.
In the landscape, trees grow at a moderate rate and can reach a height of 40' and spread 20 to 40' with trunk diameters of up to 3 feet.
The fruit of P. juliflora is a cylindrical or slightly irregularly curved green pod which turns yellow upon ripening.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Krugiodendron ferreum.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Shrub or small tree, 5-10 m tall, bark light brown, fissured, twigs nearly cylindric, puberulent.
The fragrant small flowers are yellowish-green and borne in small clusters.
The bark is grey, smooth or lightly fissured, becoming scaly on mature trees.
They are copper-red and soft when they emerge, becoming dark glossy green on top, dull green underneath, and leathery.
The leaves are arranged oppositely, to 5 cm in length, oval to ovate with an emarginate leaf apex and entire margin.
The fruit is a drupe that is purple/black at maturity.
It reaches 15 to 25 feet in height, it grows taller than it does wide.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

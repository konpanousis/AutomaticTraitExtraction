Fragrant, Showy, Semi-Evergreen, Fruit & Berries.
Prized for its smooth, lustrous coppery bark, Bursera simaruba is a large, semi-evergreen tree, with an open, irregular to rounded crown.
The leaves are compound, consisting of three to nine oval leaflets up to 7.5 cm long, arranged in pairs along the length and with an extra leaflet at the tip.
Bursera simaruba ranges from a bush to large trees over 15 meters in height.
Grows up to 25-40 ft. tall and 25-30 ft. wide.
Its most distinguishing feature is its lustrous copper coloured bark which cracks and peels off in thin, near translucent flakes.
The incomplete, imprefect actinomorphic flowers appear in before new leaves sprout during the spring in panicles.

The fruit is a red, edible hesperidium 10-15 mm diameter, similar to a small Citrus fruit.
Stem: bud with cataphyll, indumentum with hair simple.
Embryo with thin, elliptic or oblong, flat, collateral cotyledons, radicle apical, exserted, endosperm present.
Trichilia alata NE Br.
Inflorescences axillary, crowded-racemose and appearing to be fascicled, glabrous or scattered puberulent, bracts persistent, deltoid-naviculate.
Trichilia trifolia subspecies trifolia.
The flowers are inconspicuous, whitish, with yellow anthers and the small brown fruit has large pale lenticels.
Staminal tube cyathiform or short cylindrical, 2-3 mm long, 1-2 mm broad, filaments fused 1/3-2/3 their length, each terminated by 2 subulate lobes, alternate filaments often slightly shorter at least in bud, outside glabrous, inside pubescent to barbate in upper half, anthers 10, 0.5-0.8 mm long, glabrous, antherodes slender, not dehiscing, without pollen.
Trichilia palustris Dum.Cours.
Seed solitary in each valve, 0.4-0.6 cm long, shaped like a broad segment of an orange, completely surrounded by a thin fleshy arillode except for a small area on abaxial surface near base of seed, arillode free except for thin line of attachment from micropyle to raphe, seed coat thin but tough.
It is a spiny evergreen shrub growing to 3 m tall.
Flowers unisexual, plants dioecious, inflorescence axillary or clustered at apex of short lateral shoots in axils of bud scales, 0.5-2 cm long, usually a small cymose fascicle, less frequently a few-flowered slender thyrse, or rarely flowers paired or solitary, usually glabrous, often densely lenticellate, flowers subtended by small ovate bracteoles, pedicel stout, broadening imperceptibly into calyx, 0-0.5 mm long.
It dehisces to reveal a seed surrounded by an orange or reddish arillode.
Shrub or tree to 10 m. tall.
New growth subtended by a tight cluster of broadly ovate or triangular, shining brown, coriaceous bud scales, ca.
Capsule globose, brown with prominent pale lenticels usually intermixed with sparse coarse hairs, 0.5-0.8 cm diam., 3-valved, pericarp 0.2-0.5 mm thick, leathery outside, endocarp thin, cartilaginous.
Petals fleshy, 5, imbricate, 3 mm long, 1-1.5 mm broad, oblong, elliptic or spathulate, apex rounded and often slightly hooded, glabrous.
The flowers are white, with three petals 10-13 mm long and 4 mm broad.
Ovary 3-locular, loculi uniovulate, densely strigose to pubescent or less frequently glabrous, style glabrous, tapering gradually from base to apex, style-head capitate to conical.
A tree 7 m. or so high, with grayish or grayish-brown puberulent twigs, glabrous in ageleaves 3-12 cm.
Calyx thick, fleshy, cyathiform, 1-2 mm long, aestivation open, with 5 rounded or obtuse lobes, 0.25-0.5 mm long, glabrous.
Trichilia procera Forsyth ex DC.
They have capsule fruit.
Flower: petal free, petal imbricate, filament of the stamen partly adnate united, nectary present/obscure, ovary glabrous, ovary number of the locule trilocular, ovary number of the ovule per locule 1.

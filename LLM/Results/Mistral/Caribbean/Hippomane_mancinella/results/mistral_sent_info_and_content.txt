We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Hippomane mancinella.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:

Tree to 10 m, much branched forming a rounded crown, the bark gray or red, often lichen covered.
Pistillate flowers solitary or paired at proximal nodes of spikes, ovary nearly ovoid, glabrous, the styles united at base, recurved.
Pistillate calyx ca 3 mm long, ovate and somewhat acuminate.
Flowers are yellow green and inconspicuous, but the spikes or leafless stems that the flowers emerge from are visible.
The leaves are simple, alternate, very finely serrated or toothed, and 2-4 inches long.
The bark is reddish-to-grayish brown and deeply furrowed or cracked looking.
Also known as beach apple, the Manchineel is a flowering, evergreen, round-crowned tree that can grow up to 15 meters high.
Tree 8-12 m tall, glabrous, producing abundant poisonous, milky latex, bark gray, smooth.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

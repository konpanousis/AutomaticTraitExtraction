We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Crateva adansonii.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Garlic pear is a moderate sized deciduous tree, 15 m tall and 9 m wide.
Inflorescence-axis 2-5 cm long, often extending into a leafy extension after flowering.
The petals are ovate or oblong, with the claw half as long as limb.
The tree is sometimes called the spider tree because the showy flowers bear long, spidery stamens.
Leaves 3-foliolate, petiolate, leaflet shortly petiolulate, elliptic, elliptic-lanceolate, ovate-lanceolate, more or less oblique, acuminate, narrowed towards the base, 5-12 cm long, 2.5-6 cm broad, herbaceous to subcoriaceous, often turning brownish when dry, petiole 4-8 cm long.
They are elliptic with entire margins.
Petals ovate, or suborbicular, reticula¬tely veined, eventually 20-30 mm long, 10-17 mm wide, , the 2 adaxial ones generally somewhat larger.
The flowers are pale green.
Leaflets are ovate-lanceolate or ovate, 7.5 to 12 cm long, 4 to 6 cm wide, and pointed at the base, with a rather slender point at the tip.
Fruit globose, 3-5 cm in diam., yellowish, seeds reniform, about 3-4 mm in diam., smooth, brown.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

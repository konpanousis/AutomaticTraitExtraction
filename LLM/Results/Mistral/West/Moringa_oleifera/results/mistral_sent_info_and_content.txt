We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Moringa oleifera.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Type kruid of plant.
Unripe green pods are somewhat fleshy, becoming fibrous and greyish when mature, persistent on the tree.
Leaves imparipinnate, rachis 12-25 cm long, pubescent, 2-6 pairs of pinna 3-6 mm long, each with 3-5 pairs of pale green, obovate leaflets 1-2 cm long, terminal leaflets slightly larger, basal leaflet pairs sometime tripinnate.
The seeds have three whitish papery wings and are dispersed by wind and water.
The bark has a whitish-gray color and is surrounded by thick cork.

The long, pointed and triangular cross-section fruits are very distinctive, up to 1-2 cm broad, often 30-50 cm long, up to 120 cm long in some cultivated varieties, containing oily black seeds up to 1 cm in diameter in a typical 3-winged seed coat.

Moringa oleifera is an evergreen, drought-deciduous, flowering, erect, open-branched, perennial tree with somewhat drooping branches and a thick trunk.
M. oleifera is a fast-growing, deciduous tree that can reach a height of 10-12 metres and trunk diameter of 45 centimetres.
The tree has an open crown of drooping, fragile branches, and the leaves build up a feathery foliage of tripinnate leaves.
Medium to Hot Seeds.
Chorisia speciose.
Title Flowers Caption Moringa oleifera , flowers.
The length of Moringa oleifera flowers are between 1: 1.5 cm long.
Grows 8-12m tall with a 4-89m spread and a 30-60cm  trunk diameter.
Young shoots have purplish or greenish-white, hairy bark.
Sweet-scented flowers, cream white, arranged in panicles, with 5 unequal petals slightly larger than the sepals , yellow dots at the base , petals narrowly spathulate, veined, white, bracts linear, calyx 5-lobed, linear-lanceolate, reflexed, puberulous outside, 5 stamens, fertile alternating with 5-7 staminodes, filaments villous at the base, ovary 1-celled, oblong, villous, ovules many, style slender.
The flowers are fragrant and hermaphroditic, surrounded by five unequal, thinly veined, yellowish-white petals.
Blood Orange Seeds.
Sweet to Mild Seeds.
Moringa trees are fast-growing and can reach 40 feet in height, but has droopy, spindly branches, usually and hopefully weighted with long seedpods, which look sort of like a thick, ridged green bean.
The Moringa oleifera grows on thin, hairy trunk in spreading flower clusters which is between 10-25 cm in length.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

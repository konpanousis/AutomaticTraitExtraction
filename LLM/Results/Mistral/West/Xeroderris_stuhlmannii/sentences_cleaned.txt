Morphology A medium-sized to large, spreading tree usually about 10 m in height, but may be larger, common and widespread in hot, dry areas in deciduous woodland and forest and bushveld often on deep sands.
Flowers: rather small, pea-shaped, white to greenish white, in branched, terminal and axillary sprays or panicles, each 10-20 cm long, crowded at the ends of the branchlets and together forming heads up to 20 x 20 cm, frequently smaller, calyx and stalks densely covered with creamy to rusty velvety hairs, floral parts in 5s, calyx widely bell-shaped, standard petal with a short claw and widely spreading, stamens joined but the uppermost stamen free, ovary without a stalk.
Leaves: imparipinnate, spirally arranged, crowded at the tips of the branchlets, with 9-17, often 15 alternate to sub-opposite leaflets, leaflets oblong to ovate, 5-13 x 3.5-6 cm, fresh green, initially covered with fine, golden or silvery, silky hairs which are lost later, often appearing to have been folded upwards and creased along the midrib, apex rather rounded to abruptly attenuate, base rounded to shallowly lobed, asymmetric, margin entire, rather wavy, slightly rolled under, petiolules 2-5 mm long, petiole 2-7 cm long, stipules falling early.
Pod 6-25 cm, thickened over the seeds, hairless, leathery, with a prominent winged rim.
Flowers in branched axillary and terminal sprays, white to greenish white.
Leaves crowded at the ends of branches, imparipinnate with c.15 subopposite or alternate leaflets, leaflets oblong to ovate, 5-13 cm, green, appearing folded upwards along the midrib, base asymmetric.
Medium-sized to large spreading tree.
Wing-Bean, Wing-Pod.
Fruit: a large, flattened pod, 10-18 x 3-4.5 cm, conspicuously swollen over the seed-cases, with very distinctive ridged veining over the swellings, a prominent rim around the edge of the pod, and around this a hard, membranous wing up to 10 mm wide in the larger pods.
Bark: grey-brown, fairly smooth to rough, flaking, with a blood-red exudate when cut.

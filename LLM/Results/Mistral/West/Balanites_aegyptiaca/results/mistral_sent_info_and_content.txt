We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Balanites aegyptiaca.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Petal or tepal color:.
The dark green compound leaves grow out of the base of the spines.and are made up of two leaflets which are variable in size and shape.
Palmer E, Pitman N, 1972.
Leaves compound and spirally arranged on the shoots, dark green with 2 firm coriaceous leaflets, dimensions and shapes varying widely.

This is plant is multi-branched, growing up to l0m in height with a spherical crown, in one or several distinct masses.
Trunk and bark grey, deeply fissured longitudinally.
The trunk is green and the leaves are shed in the summer.
Flowers in fascicles in the leaf axils are inconspicuous and hermaphroditic.
The anthers of the inner stamens dehisce and release pollen in the morning and those of the outer ring in the afternoon.
The dark green compound-leaves grow out of the base of the spines and are made up of two leaflets which are variable in size and shape, obovate, asymmetric, bright green, leathery, with fine hairs when young.
The fluted trunk has grayish-brown, ragged bark with yellow-green patches where it is shed.
Flowers in usually few-flowered sessile or shortly pedunculate fascicles, pedicels up to 1.5 cm.
The ellipsoid fruit is normally less than 4 cm long and is green when not ripe, it ripens to a brown or pale brown fruit with a crispy skin a sticky brown or brown-green pulp around a hard stone.
Non-branched thorns develop in the leaves axils which are actually short stems.
Crown rounded, dense with long stout branchlets.
The yellow, single-seeded fruit is edible, but bitter.
The green fruit develop many months on the tree, become brownish when mature, then sweeter but also bitter.
Trees reach maturity after 25 years , and adult trees may exceed 100 years.
B. aegyptiaca is a multi-branched, spiny shrub or tree up to l0 m high.

It is a small to medium-sized dry-land shrub or tree belonging to the Zygophyllaceae plant family.
The Balanites aegyptiaca tree reaches 10 m in height with a generally narrow form.
The trunk is short and often branching from near the base and the bark is dark brown to grey.
Sepals 5.2-7 × 2.7-3.25 mm., ovate or ovate-lanceolate, coriaceous, caducous, densely pubescent outside, with long silky whitish hairs inside.
Stem with a reticulate dark brown or grey bark, branches green or greyish, stiff and brittle, always armed with stout simple green or yellowish spines.
The inflorescence consists of bunches of a few flowers which are either sessile or are borne on short stalks.
The fruit is a drupe and rather long, green and tormentose when young, turning yellow and glabrous when mature with a stone-like seed.
The flowers are green and small, typical Zygophyllaceae in structure: stary, with 5 sepals, 5 petals and 10 stamens.
Davis JB, Kay DE, Clark V, 1983.
The branches have long, straight green spines arranged in spirals.
Junior fruits are green and tormentose, turning yellow and glabrous when develop.
tree reaches 10 m in height with a narrow form.
The ellipsoid fruit is normally less than 4 cm long and is green when not ripe, it ripens to a brown or pale brown fruit with a crispy skin enclosing a sticky brown or brown-green pulp around a hard stone.
The yellow, single- seeded fruit is edible, but bitter.
The branches have long, straight green spines arranged in spirals.
The fluted trunk has grayish-brown, ragged bark with yellow-green patches where it is shed.
Petiole canaliculate, from 5 mm to 20 mm with a short rachis.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

This is plant is multi-branched, growing up to l0m in height with a spherical crown, in one or several distinct masses.
Trunk and bark grey, deeply fissured longitudinally.
The trunk is green and the leaves are shed in the summer.
Flowers in fascicles in the leaf axils are inconspicuous and hermaphroditic.
The anthers of the inner stamens dehisce and release pollen in the morning and those of the outer ring in the afternoon.
The dark green compound-leaves grow out of the base of the spines and are made up of two leaflets which are variable in size and shape, obovate, asymmetric, bright green, leathery, with fine hairs when young.
The fluted trunk has grayish-brown, ragged bark with yellow-green patches where it is shed.
Flowers in usually few-flowered sessile or shortly pedunculate fascicles, pedicels up to 1.5 cm.
The ellipsoid fruit is normally less than 4 cm long and is green when not ripe, it ripens to a brown or pale brown fruit with a crispy skin a sticky brown or brown-green pulp around a hard stone.
Non-branched thorns develop in the leaves axils which are actually short stems.
Crown rounded, dense with long stout branchlets.
The yellow, single-seeded fruit is edible, but bitter.
The green fruit develop many months on the tree, become brownish when mature, then sweeter but also bitter.
Trees reach maturity after 25 years , and adult trees may exceed 100 years.
B. aegyptiaca is a multi-branched, spiny shrub or tree up to l0 m high.
Leaf or leaflet margin:.
The individual flowers are greenish-yellow in colour, hermaphroditic with five petals in radial symmetry and are 8-14 millimetres in diameter.
Ovary densely covered with long silky hairs.
Drupe yellowish or green, up to 5 × 2.5 cm., usually subcylindric, more rarely narrowly ellipsoid or subobclavate, finely puberulous, sometimes glabrescent.
The flower buds are ovoid and covered in a short tomentose pubescence.
It is a scrubby thorny small tree, 2-6 meters tall, usually multi-trunked.
Petals 7.2-9.5 × 2-2.4 mm., narrowly elliptic or elliptic-oblong, rarely lanceolate-oblong, glabrous on both surfaces.
Perennial Seed propagated Tree Vegetatively propagated Woody.
The branches have long, straight green or yellow thorns/spines arranged in spirals.
It is a small to medium-sized dry-land shrub or tree belonging to the Zygophyllaceae plant family.
The Balanites aegyptiaca tree reaches 10 m in height with a generally narrow form.
The trunk is short and often branching from near the base and the bark is dark brown to grey.
Sepals 5.2-7 × 2.7-3.25 mm., ovate or ovate-lanceolate, coriaceous, caducous, densely pubescent outside, with long silky whitish hairs inside.
Stem with a reticulate dark brown or grey bark, branches green or greyish, stiff and brittle, always armed with stout simple green or yellowish spines.
The inflorescence consists of bunches of a few flowers which are either sessile or are borne on short stalks.
The fruit is a drupe and rather long, green and tormentose when young, turning yellow and glabrous when mature with a stone-like seed.
The flowers are green and small, typical Zygophyllaceae in structure: stary, with 5 sepals, 5 petals and 10 stamens.

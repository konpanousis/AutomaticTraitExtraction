Growing to 25 cm diameter, it has thin, grey-black bark, smooth or flaking in patches resembling the London plane , the trunk is rarely straight, with twisted branches.
Bark grey to whitish, smooth or flaking in plaques.
Capsules de 40-60 cm de long et environ 18 mm de large, glabres, cloison mediane de 10-12 mm de diam.
Morphology Drooping ample panicles of pink or purplish and darker streaked flowers 1-2 in.
Immature leaves are occasionally toothed and hairy.
Inflorescence a lax, terminal, many-flowered panicle 15-48 cm.
The calyx is campanulate, 5-6mm long and almost glabrous, the corolla is some 5 cm long, with the tube softly pubescent, panicle large, usually softly pubescent.
Pistil with cupular disk at base, slightly lobed.
Terminal leaflet usually larger, apex retuse to cuspidate, sometimes unequal, base rounded to cuneate, frequently unequal, margins entire or crenulate-sinuate, occasionally crenate or serrate, hairs occasionally confined to veins and midrib, secondary venation reticulate, lower surface usually with fine gland dots throughout and large scattered glands either side of the midrib towards the base.
The fruit is long, 4-angular, slightly curved, 30-70 cm, about 1 cm in diameter.
Slash white or light brown.
Petioles may be up to 7 cm long, and are caniculate.
Flowers fragrant, often precocious, bracts 3-4 x 0.5-0.7 mm, corolla falling off soon.
Young branches smooth or striate, frequently lenticellate, glabrous to tomentellous.
Fruit 15-60 cm long, glabrous or puberulous, finely lenticellate, often with scattered peltate glands.
Flowers are pale yellow, slightly curved, about 2 cm, upper lip 2-lobed, lower lip 3-lobed, tomentose at mouth, tube terete.
Calyx 5-10 mm long, campanulate, truncate with sinuate margins, or lobes broadly triangular to obtuse, up to 3 mm long, frequently with small mealy glands, usually with larger scattered peltate glands towards the apex, occasionally viscid.
Growing to 25 cm diameter, it has thin, grey-black bark, smooth or flaking in patches resembling the London.
Drooping ample panicles of pink or purplish and darker streaked flowers 1-2 in.
The leaf margin may be entire or sometimes toothed in coppice shoots, while petiolules are virtually absent.
Stereospermum Cham.
Stamen-filaments 6-15 mm.
Inflorescence up to 48 cm long including peduncle, most parts including calyx frequently with long white hairs when young, glabrous or pubescent to tomentose, sometimes lenticellate, pedicels frequently with small glands just below the calyx.
Corolla funnel shaped, with a pinkish tube 30-40 mm.
Fruits slender, flat capsules or paired pods up to 45 x 1 cm, cylindrical, greenish-purple, reddish-brown to dark brown, pendulous, spirally twisted, smooth, splitting into 2 valves to release many flat, long, narrow, winged seeds.
Small or medium sized tree up to 15 m. or small shrub.
Usually 5m tall, but occasionally up to 15m, with abundant, fragrant, precocious, pink or purplish flowers, making the tree a spectacular sight.
Leaves 9-43 cm long including petiole 1.5-9 cm, rachis slightly striate or grooved, frequently lenticellate, hairs not glandular.
Fruits are slender, flat, paired pods up to 60 x 1 cm, cylindrical, pendulous, spirally twisted, smooth, splitting in two and releasing many flat, long, narrow seeds winged at each end, 2.5-3 cm long.

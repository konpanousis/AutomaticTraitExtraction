We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Sclerocarya birrea.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Female flowers grow individually on their own pedicel and have staminodes.
It is characterised by a grey mottled bark.
Deciduous – Sheds Its Leaves Annually.
The compound leaves tend are mostly crowded at the end of the branches.
The tree is a single stemmed tree with a wide spreading crown.
The marula is a medium-sized to large deciduous tree with an erect trunk and rounded crown.
Sclerocarya birrea or marula tree is a medium to large , deciduous, with a wide crown and characteristic silvery, mottled bark, peeling in disc-shaped flakes.
To t but usually smaller.
Male inflorescence a terminal or axillary, drooping raceme 5-22 cm long, with flowers in groups of 3-4 towards the base but solitary towards the apex, female inflorescence reduced, subterminal and spiciform, with 1-2 flowers.
The fruits are drupes with a single seed encased within their endocarp, although up to four seeds can be present.

Sclerocarya birrea , commonly known as the marula , is a medium-sized deciduous fruit, indigenous to the miombo woodlands of Southern Africa , the Sudano-Sahelian range of West Africa , the savanna woodlands of East Africa and Madagascar.
They fall to the ground when unripe and green in colour, and then ripen to a yellow colour on the ground.
Sapling with distinctive emarginate leaflets with toothed margins, features not present in adult plants.
The small dark red flowers are unisexual and found in fragrant clusters at the end of the branches.
On rare occasion a male flower can produce a gynoecium , turning it bisexual.
The fruits, which ripen between December and March, have a light yellow skin , with white flesh.
On rare occasion a male flower can produce a gynoecium, turning it bisexual.
Leaves 18-25 x 8-15 cm,.-¦
Seedling with first leaves trifoliolate having sessile, pinnately veined leaflets with dentate margins.
The compound leaves are grey-green in colour, but turn pale yellow prior to being shed.
Red, White, Pink.
Anatomy     Wood-anatomical description : Growth rings: 2: growth ring boundaries indistinct or absent.
These have red sepals and petals, and about 20 stamens per flower.
Cydonia oblonga.
Seeds can contain 2-4 embryos.
The fruit contains a large hard seed, surrounding two or more edible kernels, rich in oil.
The plum sized fruits are covered in a soft, leathery, pale green-yellow exocarp which encloses the juicy white flesh.
Fruit: Fruits are plum-sized, dropping to the ground while still.slightly green, and ripening naturally under the tree.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

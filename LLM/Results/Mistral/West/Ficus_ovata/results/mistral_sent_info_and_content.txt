We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Ficus ovata.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The fruits.are dehiscent, the grains which are with or without endosperms have equal or.unequal cotyledons.
The attractive bronze stipules effectively sheath the terminal buds.
Ficus lutea is a large, briefly-deciduous tree, capable of growing to 25 m in height.
The bark is relatively smooth-textured and dark grey to brown in colour.
The ovary of Ficus has a.lateral style.
The syconia , borne most often between June and October, are crowded towards the ends of the branchlets in the leaf axils or below the leaves.
The latter is distinguished in having 7 to 11 pairs of lateral veins in the leaves as opposed to the 6 to 8 evident in F. lutea , and stalked fruit, the fruit of F. lutea being sessile.
The figs are borne singly or in pairs in the leaf axils or on old wood.
The young ones of Moraceae.plants are characterised by their first leaves which is simple opposite or.sub-opposite.
M -1 CM -1 ).
Tree to about 15 m. tall, or a shrub, terrestrial or starting as an epiphyte or lithophyte.
The branches are covered with a fluffy greenish grey bark.
Male flowers have one or two stamens,.rarely more.
Tree up to 10 m. tall, hemi-epiphytic and strangling or terrestrial, sometimes a shrub or a liane.
Figs solitary in the leaf axils, just below the leaves, or sometimes also on the older wood, initially enveloped by an ovoid calyptrate bud-cover up to 2.5 cm.
The younger parts of the tree, such as the young leaves, branches and petioles, are covered with golden to greyish hairs, or it may show almost a lack of hairs.
The older leaves fall to the ground and are responsible for leaving large scars behind.
The leaves are discolorous, glabrous above and finely tomentose below.
Its large, spreading crown can span 30 to 45 m in width.
Although exhibiting many distinctive characters, Ficus lutea can superficially resemble F. trichopoda with which there is some distribution overlap.
Leaves are simple, oval-shaped to oblong, 50-150 xÂ— 20-90 mm, dark green and smooth on the upper surface and lighter green on the lower surface.
Leaves spirally arranged, lamina ovate to elliptic, subovate or oblong 9-31 x
Leaf shape is very variable.
The bark is pale grey to yellowish grey and has a smooth to slightly rough texture, it often tends to flake off, but creates a nice decorative look.
The flowers are minute and unisexual , they.cluster on flat or hollow receptacle.
The family of Moraceae belongs to plant kingdom, branch of.phanerogames, sub-branch of angiosperm, class of dicotyledonous, sub-class of.monochlamides and order of urticals.
Figs solitary in the leaf-axils, just below the leaves, or sometimes also on the older wood, initially enveloped by an ovoid calyptrate coriaceous bud-cover up to 2.5 cm.
The lovely smooth, glossy leaves are very large in size, as the common name would suggest, and are quite distinctive, ranging from 130 to 430 mm in length and up to 200 mm in width.
Ficus glumosa.
Branches may be finely hairy when young, becoming smooth with age.
Their unisexual.flowers are dioic or monoic and it is fixed on the plant directly.
Figs green with white spots, each pair covered when young by a brown calyptra Provided by:.
Clustered, sessile fruits are produced in the leaf axils towards the end of the branches from early spring until late summer.
Ficus glumosa can easily grow up to 15 m high, the crown is roundish and may be open or closed, the branches of the tree tends to grow quite low.
A tree to 40 ft. high, with large crown, often epiphytic at first.
The shape may be whole or lobed and.the edges rough or smooth.
The leaf margins are entire and the stout leaf stalks measure from 25 to 150 mm in length.
In female flowers, the stamens are numerous and pedicellate.
The bark is pale grey-brown with regularly spaced paler latitudinal stripes, and small crumb-like scales over the general surface on top of longitudinal papery scales.
Morphology A tree to 40 ft. high, with large crown, often epiphytic at first Provided by:.
Fructose. 0.
Ficus ovata Vahl , Enum.
The mature figs are typically ellipsoid, green with whitish spots.
They are held towards the ends of the branches, are ovate to elliptic or obovate, and exhibit clear yellow veining.
Figs green with white spots, each pair covered when young by a brown calyptra.
Tree up to 10 m. tall, hemi-epiphytic or terrestrial, sometimes a shrub or lianescent.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

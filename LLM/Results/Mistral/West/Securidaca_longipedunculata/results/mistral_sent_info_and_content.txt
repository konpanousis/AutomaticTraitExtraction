We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Securidaca longipedunculata.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Ciao, sono Symptoma.
Young stems usually densely pubescent.
Posterior sepal up to 5 x 4 mm.
Samares de 5-7 cm de long.
Flower Colour. ?.
They are sweetly scented and grow in small bunches on a peduncle.
Small tree, up to 6 m high.
The tree produces flowers in the early part of the austral summer, and these progress from a pink to purple colour.
Diagnostic Description The genus Securidaca can be separated from other Polygalaceae on the combination of one locular samaroid fruit, eight stamens and three petals.
Its small branches are covered in very fine hair.
Deciduous or Evergreen. ?.
Fruit 3-5 x 0.8-2 cm., with an oblong or elliptic somewhat obliquely curved wing, sometimes with a second rudimentary wing.
Terminal and axillary sprays are about 30-50 mm long, appearing with the very young leaves.
Herbaceous or Woody. ?.
Leaves broadly oblong to narrowly elliptic, 10-50 x 5-18 mm.
It has pale grey, smooth bark with leaves that grow in clusters.
Flowers are sweetly scented, in short bunches, pink to purple and are produced in early summer.
Leaves are variable in size and shape, alternate, often in clusters or crowded on dwarf spur branchlets which are sometimes spine-tipped.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

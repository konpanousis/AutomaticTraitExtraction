The bark of B. micrantha is silver-grey to black in colour, smooth or rough with lenticels and reticulately fissured and flaking.
Younger trees have rather smooth, very finely reticulately fissured, pale, silvery-grey to grey-brown bark, which turns darker and roughens in texture as the trees mature.

They are glossy, dark green above, paler green below, smooth or very finely hairy, especially on the under surfaces.
The flowers are petite, pretty, buttery-yellow and are followed by sweetly flavoured, currant-like fruits that ripen to a deep purple-black and are loved by birds.

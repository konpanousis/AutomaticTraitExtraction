We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Bridelia micrantha.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Bridelia ndellensis Beille is a small tree up to 15 m tall with bole up to 30 cm in diameter, distributed from southern Nigeria eastward to Sudan and Uganda.
It develops a straight, stout trunk with a spreading crown of dense branches, and the leaves are simple, large and glossy green above and paler below.
Flower, many flowered in glomerules and occurs at the axillary.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

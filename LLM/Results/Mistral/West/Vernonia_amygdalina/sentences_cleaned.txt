Phyllaries many, tightly appressed-imbricate at first, thinly cartilaginous, sometimes puberulous and glandular at the apex and ciliate on the margins, otherwise glabrous, the outer phyllaries from c. 1 mm.
Stems slender with a pale-brown closely longitudinally furrowed bark, branches and twigs greyish pubescent, the indumentum of 1-armed T-shaped hairs.

The leaves are green with a characteristic odour and a bitter taste.
Morphology Capitula very numerous in terminal, divaricately branching, rounded panicles, stalks 3-12 mm.
Description     Shrub or small tree up to 10 m tall, much branched, trunk up to 40 cm in diameter, bark grey to brown, smooth, becoming fissured, young branches densely pubescent.

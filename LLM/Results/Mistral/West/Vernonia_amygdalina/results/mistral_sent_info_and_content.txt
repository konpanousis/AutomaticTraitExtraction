We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Vernonia amygdalina.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Flowers bisexual, regular, 5-merous, strongly exserted from the involucre, pappus consisting of outer linear, caducous scales up to 1.5 mm long and of inner creamy or brownish bristles 4-7 mm long, corolla tubular, 5-8 mm long, whitish, glandular, with erect lobes, stamens with anthers united into a tube, with appendages at apex, ovary inferior, 1-celled, pubescent and glandular, style hairy, 2-branched.
Towards the dry season new leaves become smaller and become dark greyish green in colour, these are very coarse and bitter, especially those close to the inflorescence.
A many-stemmed shrub or small tree up to c. 8 m. tall.
Leaves petiolate, elliptic, lanceolate or ovate, 4-15 cm long, 1.2-4 cm wide, base cuneate or rounded, margins minutely remotely denticulate to coarsely serrate, apex shortly acuminate, apiculate, rather thinly pubescent and glabrescent except for the midrib above, finely crispate-pubescent especially on the veins and often ± glabrescent beneath, petiole 0.2-4 cm long.
Bitter leaf is a shrub or small tree which grows to three to eight meters high with striated pubescent branches, becoming glabrous on maturity.

Del is a shrub of 2-5 m tall with petiolate green leaves of about 6mm diameter and it is popularly known as bitter leaf.
Shrub or small tree 0.5-10 m tall, much-branched, spreading, coppice-growing, trunk up to 40 cm in diameter, bark grey or brown, smooth, becoming longitudinally fissured, slash green, becoming black on exposure, stems pubescent with asymmetrical T-shaped hairs.
Phyllaries many, tightly appressed-imbricate at first, thinly cartilaginous, sometimes puberulous and glandular at the apex and ciliate on the margins, otherwise glabrous, the outer phyllaries from c. 1 mm.
Stems slender with a pale-brown closely longitudinally furrowed bark, branches and twigs greyish pubescent, the indumentum of 1-armed T-shaped hairs.

Description     Shrub or small tree up to 10 m tall, much branched, trunk up to 40 cm in diameter, bark grey to brown, smooth, becoming fissured, young branches densely pubescent.
Its flowers in heads, 6 mm in diameter and in copious corymbose panicles, pappus white or russet and sweet-scented.
Achenes 1.7-3.5 mm long, 10-ribbed, thinly pubescent and usually glandular, outer pappus of linear scales, often scant, caducous, 0.2-1.3 mm long, inner of cream or brownish bristles 4-7 mm long, distally flattened.
A1, A2, A3, A4 Vernonia amygdalina Bitter.
Amygdalina typically grows to a height of about 1 - 5 metres and it is non-bitter.
Vernonia amygdalina is a shrub or small tree of 2-5 m with petiolate leaf of about 6cm diameter and elliptic shape.
Fruit a 10-ribbed achene 1.5-3.5 mm long, pubescent and glandular, brown to black, crowned by the much longer pappus bristles.
Leaves alternate, simple, stipules absent, petiole 0.2-4 cm long, blade ovate-elliptical to lanceolate, 4-15 cm x 1-4 cm, cuneate or rounded at base, shortly acuminate at apex, margin minutely toothed to coarsely serrate, finely pubescent but often glabrescent, pinnately veined.
Leaves with petioles 0.2-1.5 cm.
The leaves are alternate i.e. only one leaf is produced at each node, obovate-lanceolate in shape, with entire or finely toothed margin, finely pubescent beneath.
The leaves are elliptical and up to 20 cm long.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

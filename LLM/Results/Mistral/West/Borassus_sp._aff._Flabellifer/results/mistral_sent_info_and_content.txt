We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Borassus sp. aff. Flabellifer.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Pollen monosulcate, elliptical, 51 - 72 Î¼m long, aperture 47 - 61 Î¼m long, polar axis 49 - 61 Î¼m long, tectum reticulate, densely covered with supratectal gemmae.
Pistillate flowers 3.5 x 3 cm, bracteoles 2 cm diam., sepals 2 x 2 cm, petals 1.5 x 1.5 cm.
Stem to 15 m tall, almost always ventricose, to 80 cm in diam., when stem marked by numerous irregular scars, this is caused by tapping.
Fruits large, ± 15 cm long and ± 12 cm diameter, ovoid with a somewhat pointed apex, fragrant and yellowish green at maturity, produced inside persistent perianth segments, pyrenes 1 - 3, 6.8 - 9.3 cm x 5.4 - 7.5 cm.
Pistillate flowers 3.5 x 3 cm, bracteoles 2 cm diam., sepals 2 x 2 cm, petals 1.5 x 1.5 cm.
Staminate inflorescences branched to two orders, upper subtending branches terminating in 1 - 3 rachillae, rachillae green-brown and catkin-like, 23 - 36 cm long, 2.3 - 2.5 cm diameter, usually with a mamilliform apex, rachilla bracts forming pits that contain a cincinnus of 5 - 10 staminate flowers.
Pistillate inflorescences spicate or branched to one order, rachis ± 80 cm long, flower-bearing portion 24 - 39 cm long with ± 23 flowers arranged spirally.
Branching may occur in the rachis towards the base of the inflorescence, or in the flower-bearing rachillae.
Leaves glaucous, 8 - 22 in the crown, petiole and sheath 90 - 160 cm long, petiole 3.0 - 7.4 cm wide at midpoint, green, margins with small serrate black teeth , or teeth largely absent, costa 22 - 28 cm long, adaxial hastula conspicuous, to 2.4 cm, abaxial hastula rudimentary, lamina rather flat, radius to 160 cm maximum, dense indumentum on the ribs of some immature leaves, leaflets 45 - 82, 2.8 - 7.3 cm wide, apices acute and entire or splitting longitudinally with age, shortest leaflet 58 - 147 cm long, leaf divided to 60 - 99 cm, commissural veins 5 - 7 per cm, leaf anatomy isolateral.
Pistillate flowers 3.5 x 3 cm, bracteoles 2 cm in diam., sepals 2 x 2 cm, petals 1.5 x 1.5 cm.
Pistillate inflorescences spicate or branched to one order, rachis ± 80 cm long, flower-bearing portion 24 - 39 cm long with ± 23 flowers arranged spirally.
Fruits large, ± 15 cm long and ± 12 cm diameter, ovoid with a somewhat pointed apex, fragrant and yellowish green at maturity, produced inside persistent perianth segments, pyrenes 1 - 3, 6.8 - 9.3 cm x 5.4 - 7.5 cm. /Palmweb.
The commissural veins in the leaves are spaced further apart than in any species except B. heineanus.
The fruits are yellow-green with a pointed apex, thus resembling those of B. madagascariensis, but they are considerably smaller.
The similarities are largely a matter of scale, as B. akeassii is considerably smaller than other African Borassus species.
Stem to 15 m tall, almost always ventricose, to 80 cm diam., when stem marked by numerous irregular scars, this is caused by tapping.
Fruits large, ± 15 cm long and ± 12 cm diameter, ovoid with a somewhat pointed apex, fragrant and yellowish green at maturity, produced inside persistent perianth segments, pyrenes 1 - 3, 6.8 - 9.3 cm x 5.4 - 7.5 cm.
Pollen monosulcate, elliptical, 51 - 72 mm long, aperture 47 - 61 mm long, polar axis 49 - 61 mm long, tectum reticulate, densely covered with supratectal gemmae.
Staminate flowers 0.4 - 0.6 cm long, exserted from the pits individually or in groups of 3 - 5, bracteoles 0.8 x 0.5 cm, calyx 0.5 x 0.2 cm, shallowly divided into three sepals, petal lobes 0.2 x 0.1 cm, stamens 6 with very short filaments, 0.1 x 0.03 cm, anthers, 0.1 x 0.05 cm, pistillode minute.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

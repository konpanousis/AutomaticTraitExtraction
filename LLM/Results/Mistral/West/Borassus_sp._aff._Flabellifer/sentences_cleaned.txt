Pistillate flowers 3.5 x 3 cm, bracteoles 2 cm diam., sepals 2 x 2 cm, petals 1.5 x 1.5 cm.
Stem to 15 m tall, almost always ventricose, to 80 cm in diam., when stem marked by numerous irregular scars, this is caused by tapping.
Fruits large, ± 15 cm long and ± 12 cm diameter, ovoid with a somewhat pointed apex, fragrant and yellowish green at maturity, produced inside persistent perianth segments, pyrenes 1 - 3, 6.8 - 9.3 cm x 5.4 - 7.5 cm.
Pistillate flowers 3.5 x 3 cm, bracteoles 2 cm diam., sepals 2 x 2 cm, petals 1.5 x 1.5 cm.
Staminate inflorescences branched to two orders, upper subtending branches terminating in 1 - 3 rachillae, rachillae green-brown and catkin-like, 23 - 36 cm long, 2.3 - 2.5 cm diameter, usually with a mamilliform apex, rachilla bracts forming pits that contain a cincinnus of 5 - 10 staminate flowers.
Pistillate inflorescences spicate or branched to one order, rachis ± 80 cm long, flower-bearing portion 24 - 39 cm long with ± 23 flowers arranged spirally.
Branching may occur in the rachis towards the base of the inflorescence, or in the flower-bearing rachillae.
Leaves glaucous, 8 - 22 in the crown, petiole and sheath 90 - 160 cm long, petiole 3.0 - 7.4 cm wide at midpoint, green, margins with small serrate black teeth , or teeth largely absent, costa 22 - 28 cm long, adaxial hastula conspicuous, to 2.4 cm, abaxial hastula rudimentary, lamina rather flat, radius to 160 cm maximum, dense indumentum on the ribs of some immature leaves, leaflets 45 - 82, 2.8 - 7.3 cm wide, apices acute and entire or splitting longitudinally with age, shortest leaflet 58 - 147 cm long, leaf divided to 60 - 99 cm, commissural veins 5 - 7 per cm, leaf anatomy isolateral.
Pistillate flowers 3.5 x 3 cm, bracteoles 2 cm in diam., sepals 2 x 2 cm, petals 1.5 x 1.5 cm.
Pistillate inflorescences spicate or branched to one order, rachis ± 80 cm long, flower-bearing portion 24 - 39 cm long with ± 23 flowers arranged spirally.
Fruits large, ± 15 cm long and ± 12 cm diameter, ovoid with a somewhat pointed apex, fragrant and yellowish green at maturity, produced inside persistent perianth segments, pyrenes 1 - 3, 6.8 - 9.3 cm x 5.4 - 7.5 cm. /Palmweb.
The commissural veins in the leaves are spaced further apart than in any species except B. heineanus.
The fruits are yellow-green with a pointed apex, thus resembling those of B. madagascariensis, but they are considerably smaller.
The similarities are largely a matter of scale, as B. akeassii is considerably smaller than other African Borassus species.
Stem to 15 m tall, almost always ventricose, to 80 cm diam., when stem marked by numerous irregular scars, this is caused by tapping.
Fruits large, ± 15 cm long and ± 12 cm diameter, ovoid with a somewhat pointed apex, fragrant and yellowish green at maturity, produced inside persistent perianth segments, pyrenes 1 - 3, 6.8 - 9.3 cm x 5.4 - 7.5 cm.
Pollen monosulcate, elliptical, 51 - 72 mm long, aperture 47 - 61 mm long, polar axis 49 - 61 mm long, tectum reticulate, densely covered with supratectal gemmae.
Staminate flowers 0.4 - 0.6 cm long, exserted from the pits individually or in groups of 3 - 5, bracteoles 0.8 x 0.5 cm, calyx 0.5 x 0.2 cm, shallowly divided into three sepals, petal lobes 0.2 x 0.1 cm, stamens 6 with very short filaments, 0.1 x 0.03 cm, anthers, 0.1 x 0.05 cm, pistillode minute.

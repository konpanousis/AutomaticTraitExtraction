We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Sterculia setigera.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The bark is smooth, greyish and detached in plates.
Growth Habit - N/A.
Fruit is a sessile follicle, 6-10 cm long, oblong in shape, grey-green or brown in color and many seeded, follicle can stay on tree even when seeds falls off.
Inflorescence is raceme type, calyx, 5 lobed, up to 12 mm in diameter, outer surface is green while inner surface is purple-red.
Young branches softly tomentose.
Leaves are simple and alternate in arrangement, nerves palmately arranged at base with leaves 5 entire or pointed lobes, leaf-blade is ovate to orbicular in outline, upper surface tends to be stellate and tomentose.
Wood white and soft, of little value.
The fruits are arched follicles,.velvety, brownish-yellowish.
Sterculia may be monoecious or dioecious , and its flowers unisexual or bisexual.
Large shrub or tree 4.5-12 m tall, bole often buttressed at the base.
A deciduous, savannah tree, to 40 ft. high.
Seeds with stout, peg-like stalks 2-3 mm long, persisting on old fruits, seeds ellipsoid, 11-12 mm long, 7-8 mm wide, greyblack, hilum sub-apical, round, 1 mm wide, at the margin of the aril, aril large, rounded, apical, 5 mm wide, 2 mm high, red, drying orange or red.
The leaves that grow.only during the rainy season are alternate and lobed.
Ripe fruit capsules releasing their smooth seeds, Malaysia.
It is a tree up to 10 to 15 meters tall with a cylindrical.trunk.
A deciduous tree that is capable of reaching 18 meters in height, it has an open spreading crown with buttressed base, its grey purple bark peels off in thin, irregular scales leaving pale patches, while a slash reveals a fibrous, brownish to red inner bark and a white exudate.
Flowers with perianth green outside, red inside, widely campanulate, 9.5-13 mm long, 11-16 mm wide, divided into 5 oblong acute lobes, 5-9 mm long, 3-4 mm wide, outside velutinous, densely covered with short yellow-brown stellate hairs which completely obscure the epidermis, inside glabrous apart from the upper 2/3-3/4 of the lobes which more sparsely covered in patent white, simple hairs.
Yielding a white gum.
Fruiting carpels usually 4-5, grey to brownish outside, beaked, velvety inside with pungent bristles along the placenta line.
Flowers dull red or yellowish-green with red streaks, appearing before the new foliage.
Bark grey-purple, rough, flaking to leave pale patches, slash meat-red with paler streaks, watery, with white gum, ultimate branchlets yellowish brown tomentose to tomentellous, 3-7 mm wide, at length becoming ridged, rough, grey and exfoliating, bud-scales triangular, 2-2.5 mm long, 1.5-1.8 mm wide, tomentellous.
It is distinguished from the latter by the 6-8-armed stellate hairs that make the lower leaf-blade tomentose and the perianth yellow-brown velvety, and are so dense as to entirely obscure the epidermis below.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

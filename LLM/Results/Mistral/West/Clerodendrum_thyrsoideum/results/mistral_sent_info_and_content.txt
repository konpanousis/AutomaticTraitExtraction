We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Clerodendrum thyrsoideum.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Leaves decussate or whorled , never spiny as in some close relatives.
Stamens 4-5, didynamous, inserted in the corolla-tube, alternate with the lobes, usually long-exserted.

Disc usually poorly developed to absent.
Corolla tube 5-lobed, the lobes usually unequal.
C. floribundum can grow to 30 m tall.
Leaves simple, opposite decussate or 3-4-verticillate, usually petiolate, caducous, lamina entire, undulate, dentate or crenate, petiole articulated, sometimes the lower part persisting as a woody spine.
Corolla symmetrical in bud or, if asymmetrical, usually expanding abruptly on upper side due to resupination, actinomorphic, tube ± long, narrowly cylindrical or funnel-shaped, limb of 5 equal or subequal spreading or reflexed lobes, anterior corolla lobe only slightly larger than the others.

Corolla almost regular, tube cylindrical, limb with spreading lobes, ± symmetrical in bud.
Flowers greenish, yellowish or white.
Style terminal, slender, ± equalling the filaments, stigma exserted, 2-fid, the lobes equal short, slender, acute.

Close-up of a C. quadriloculare flower.
Flowers in lax cymes, extensive panicles or dense corymbs or heads, axillary or terminal, often appearing axillary but actually terminating abbreviated shoots, rarely solitary.
After the pollen is shed, the stamens curl up or bend over, and the style straightens out, bringing the stigma to the center of the flower.

They are shrubs , lianas , and small trees , usually growing to 1-12 m tall, with opposite or whorled leaves.
Definitie: An autotroph which is capable of transforming light into chemical energy.

When the flower opens, the stamens stand erect, parallel to the central axis of the flower, while the style bends over, holding the stigma beyond the rim of the corolla.
Trees, lianas, shrubs, subshrubs and rarely perennial or annual herbs, often ill-scented.
Flowers in cymes arranged in panicles, corymbs, heads or clusters.
Corolla red to yellow, pink, or white.
Corolla variable in colour, actinomorphic to subactinomorphic, usually hypocrateriform, or 1-lipped with anterior lip present, but usually facing upward due to resupination, 5-lobed, anterior lobe sometimes slightly larger than others, corolla in bud symm.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Corolla symmetrical in bud or, if asymmetrical, usually expanding abruptly on upper side due to resupination, actinomorphic, tube ± long, narrowly cylindrical or funnel-shaped, limb of 5 equal or subequal spreading or reflexed lobes, anterior corolla lobe only slightly larger than the others.
They are shrubs, lianas, and small trees, usually growing to 1 - tall, with opposite or whorled leaves.
Flowers in lax or ± dense cymes grouped in axillary or terminal racemose, corymbose, paniculate or head-like ± compact inflorescences.
Corolla almost regular, tube cylindrical, limb with spreading lobes, ± symmetrical in bud.
Flowers greenish, yellowish or white.
Style terminal, slender, ± equalling the filaments, stigma exserted, 2-fid, the lobes equal short, slender, acute.
Ovary unlobed to shallowly 4-lobed.
Close-up of a C. quadriloculare flower.
Flowers in lax cymes, extensive panicles or dense corymbs or heads, axillary or terminal, often appearing axillary but actually terminating abbreviated shoots, rarely solitary.
After the pollen is shed, the stamens curl up or bend over, and the style straightens out, bringing the stigma to the center of the flower.
Trees, shrubs, lianes or subshrubs.
They are shrubs , lianas , and small trees , usually growing to 1-12 m tall, with opposite or whorled leaves.
Definitie: An autotroph which is capable of transforming light into chemical energy.
Definition: whole plant herbaceous.

Ovary imperfectly 4-locular, each locule with one lateral ovule.
Drupes often 4-grooved or 4-lobed, endocarp bony, separating into 4 stones or 2 pairs of stones.
Sepals usually connate, often colored, usually accrescent.
Fruit a drupe , usually with 4 grooves or lobes, 4- seeded.
Corolla white, blue, violet or red, almost regular or quite irregular, tube narrowly cylindrical, straight or curved, often widened towards throat, sometimes very long or only as long as calyx, limb spreading or reflexed, the anterior lobes larger than the posterior pairs.
Ovary imperfectly 4-celled, each cell with 1 lateral ovule, style terminal, stigma 2-fid, with equal lobes, exserted.
Calyx campanulate to tubular, truncate to 5-lobed.
Stamens 4 , usually in 2 pairs of unequal length and projecting well beyond the mouth of the corolla.
Climbing shrub 3-60 ft. high with puberulous branches.
Definitie: whole plant herbaceous.
Leaves decussate or whorled, never spiny as in some close relatives.
Calyx usually regular, campanulate to tubular or cup-shaped, ± deeply 5-lobed or truncate, sometimes 5-angled, usually persistent and accrescent in fruit.
Calyx usually actinomorphic, usually accrescent, often showy, 5-lobed.
Fruit drupaceous, obovoid or globose, often 4-grooved, 4-lobed, mesocarp ± fleshy, endocarp bony or crustaceous, separated into four 1-seeded pyrenes or 2 pairs of pyrenes, seed without albumen.
Trees, shrubs or lianes or occasionally perennial herbs or pyrophytes with large woody rootstocks, sometimes with persistent spinescent petiole-bases often acting as scrambling aids.
Definitie: whole plant growth form.
Perennial herbs or suffrutices with woody rootstocks, shrubs , lianes or trees.
Calyx often coloured and showy, campanulate to tubular, truncate to 5-toothed, often accrescent in fruit.
Stamens 4-5, inserted in the corolla-tube, usually long-exserted, anthers versatile.
Ovary incompletely 4-locular.
Style terminal, elongate, stigma shortly 2-fid, exserted.
Stamens 4, subequal to didynamous, exserted, filaments straight or arched , anthers versatile, thecae parallel, separate at dehiscence.
Fruit drupaceous with four 1-seeded pyrenes or a schizocarp with four fleshy , 1-seeded mericarps , endosperm absent.
C. floribundum can grow to 30 m tall.
Stigma lobes equal or subequal.
Sepals usually connate , often colored, usually accrescent.
Leaves opposite , usually petiolate, simple, entire or toothed, rarely lobed.
When the flower opens, the stamens stand erect, parallel to the central axis of the flower, while the style bends over, holding the stigma beyond the rim of the corolla.
Trees, lianas, shrubs, subshrubs and rarely perennial or annual herbs, often ill-scented.
Flowers in cymes arranged in panicles, corymbs, heads or clusters.
Corolla red to yellow, pink, or white.
Corolla variable in colour, actinomorphic to subactinomorphic, usually hypocrateriform, or 1-lipped with anterior lip present, but usually facing upward due to resupination, 5-lobed, anterior lobe sometimes slightly larger than others, corolla in bud symm.

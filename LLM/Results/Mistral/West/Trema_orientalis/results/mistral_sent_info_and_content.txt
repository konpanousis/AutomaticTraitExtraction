We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Trema orientalis.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The leaf base is frequently unequal.
The leaves are bright green and have finely-toothed margins and 3-veined from the base.
.Drupes ovoid or sub-globose smooth, purplish-black when ripe, crowned with reflexed cymes.
.Axillary, pubescent fascicled cymes, sometimes dichotomously branched cymes and longer than petioles.
Ripe fruit and bark.
Flowers are small, inconspicuous and greenish, carried in short dense bunches.
Trema bark is smooth and light grey with conspicuous lenticels.
No. 46 Description: Medium sized, semi-deciduous tree with a smooth grey bark and spreading canopy, often near water.
It is quite difficult to distinguish its leaves from those of Celtis africana , but they are usually bigger and more elongated.
Branch bent down to show leaves and fruit.
Tree Shrub Herb Climbers Succulents Grasses Sedges.
They are generally small trees, reaching 10-20 m tall.
A dioecious, evergreen tree with branches spreading pubescent, bark grey, soft rough, lenticellate.
They are carried on very short stalks - this is the easiest way to tell this tree apart from the white stinkwood whose stalks are up to 13 mm long.
.Sepals 2-3 mm long, elliptic-lanceolate.
Trema orientalis and Cannabaceae . See more Â» Cannabis Cannabis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cannabaceae.
The leaves are simple, alternate, stipulate although the stipules drop early, and usually 3-nerved from the base.
.Seeds minute with membranous testa.
Reclame maken.
Trema orientalis  is a fast-growing shade tree with soft foliage, best suited to gardens and streets in the warmer and wetter regions of southern Africa.
Genus of flowering plants belonging to the hop and hemp family.
.Stamens 5, stigmas villous, reflexed in fruits.
The flowers are inconspicuous, yellow green and the fruits are small and purple or black.
Green and ripe fruit.
Leaf margins are finely serrated, and the young leaves are rough and hairy, occasionally becoming smooth when old.
Flowers appear irregularly from late winter to autumn.
Leaves : Ovate-lanceolate, acuminate at apex, rounded or obliquely cordate at base, crenate-serrate along the margins, hispid above, white tomentose beneath, petiolate, petioles pubescent, terete ventrally grooved, stipules deciduous.
The fruit is a small drupe 3-5 mm in diameter.
Leaves taper from the base to the apex, and vary from 60 to 150 mm long and 25 to 50 mm wide.
The leaves are alternate, simple, 7-15 cm long, ovate-acuminate to lanceolate with a long pointed tip, and evenly serrated margins.
Fruits are small, round and green, becoming black when ripe.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Anogeissus leiocarpus.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
.The roundish fruit is 4-10 mm x 6-11 mm x 2 to 2.5 millimeters in size and has two wings.
The gray and light to dark brown mottled bark contains a dark resin.
Anogeissus leiocarpa is a tall deciduous tree native to the savannas of tropical Africa.
The anthers are heart-shaped.
There are ten stamens present.
The fruit are winged samaras , and are dispersed by ants.
The seed is ovate - shaped mandrel in a length of about 3 millimeters and a diameter of about 2 millimeters.
.The change - up against almost constant leaves are divided into petiole and leaf blade.
The thread-like stamens are about 3 millimeters long.
The straight trunk has a diameter of up to 1 meter.
The style is filiform.Fruit
The lateral or terminal buds are spherical with a diameter of 0.5 to 2 centimeters.
Agronomist Dr Mohamed Adam Suleiman says the tree could in some cases reach a hieght of 20 meters.
The initially silky hairy leaf surfaces have four to eight pairs of lateral nerves.
The bark of the branches is hairy fluffy.
The stem-like base of the flower is 3-4 mm long.
The under constant, unilocular ovary is hairy above its mid- rust.
The petiole is 1-6 mm long.
The yellow to reddish-brown when ripe fruit is beaked short and contains only one seed.
The easy ganzrandige leaf blade is at a length of 2 to 10 inches and a width of 1 to 4 centimeters ovate to elliptic or ovate - lanceolate with wedge-shaped to obtuse Spreitenbasis and blunt or pointed top.
The inflorescence stem is up to 2.5 inches long.
The colour of its trunk and branches is whitish grey.
The five bright yellow sepals are fused bell-shaped with a length of about 1 mm.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Andira inermis.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Panicles terminal and axillary, well branched, 15-40 cm.
Andira inermis is a tall evergreen tree with a luxuriant, spreading canopy of large, glossy, rich green leaves and attractively scented small flowers , bark fissured and scaly, with an unpleasant cabbage-like smell.
The trunk frequently forms buttresses up to 3m tall.
Compared to other Faboideae the genus has unusual systems of root nodules and fruits, which are drupes.
Pendulous fruits, resembling a small mango.
The comparison revealed the follwing.
Branchlets with small reddish-brown mostly spreading hairs at the tips, soon glabrescent, covered with small closely arranged lenticels.
The Tree: Evergreen,unbuttressed, moderate-sized trees, diameters of 20 to 28 in., heights of 90 to120 ft, and clear boles 60 to 70 ft long are not uncommon.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

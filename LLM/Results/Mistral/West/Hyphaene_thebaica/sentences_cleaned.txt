Abstract The Hyphaene thebaica one of the palm plant, belong to Arecaceae family.
The bark is fairly smooth, dark grey and bears the scars of fallen leaves.
The leaves, of green-grey colour, are costapalmate, wide up to 1,5 metres, a divided in rigid segments, on a long petiole equipped of blackish thorns at the margins.
Older leaves are bitter and unpalatable.
Seeds 2-3.5 x 3 cm, ivory in colour, trunkate at base, apex obtuse.Hyphaene

Branches of female spadices stouter, in the fruiting stage marked by densely tomentose cushions after the fall of the fruit.
Male flowers shortly stalked, solitary in pits of the spadix, spathe-bracts encircling the spadix, pointed.
The tree has a Y-shaped trunk and the leaf is shaped like a large fan.
The leaves vary from green to gray and are held by beautiful, bright yellow leaf stalks which are armed with black thorns along their margins.
On germination, the cotyledon stalk buries the radicle and plumule to a depth of 60 cm.

Fruit : pear shaped, brown, 3" long, reportedly edible.
Male and female flowers on separate trees.
Inflorescences unisexual, interfoliar, pistillate and staminate inflorescences similar.
Trunk : single, though in California usually branches at ground level , 20" diameter, retained split leaf bases for up to 10' or so, then trunk tends to clean itself, tan.
Pistillate flowers larger than staminate, borne solitary in each pit, subtended by a membranous bracteole, supported by a short, thick, densely hairy pedicel, sepals 3, distinct, triangular-rounded, imbricate, striate, petals 3, similar to the sepals but more flexible, staminodes 6, fused in an epipetalous ring, sagittated, flattened, anthers undifferentiated, gynoecium globose, 3-carpellate, 3-ovulated but only reaching maturity.
Male and female flowers are produced on separate trees.
They are 6-10 x 6-8 cm, smooth, rectangular to cubical, with rounded edges, shiny brown when ripe, about 120 g each when fresh, 60 g when dry, each containing a single seed.
The inflorescence is similar in both sexes, up to 1.2 m long, with short branches at irregular intervals and 2-3 spikes arising from each branch.
Dioecious tree up to 20 m tall, with dichotomous branching, trunk solitary, up to 40 cm in diameter, soon dividing into 2 branches, which may divide again to give 8 crowns, most of the trunk covered with leaf bases breaking up into fibres near the base of the trunk.
Seed shaped like fruit, 3-4 cm x 2.5-4 cm, endosperm white, with hollow centre.
Flowers unisexual, 3-merous.
Leaves 120 x 180 cm, fan shaped, borne in tufts at the ends of branches with the blade divided into segments about 60 cm long, margins entire, leaf stalk about 60-100 cm long, sheathing at the base with numerous upwardly curving hooks.
The inflorescences are similar in general appearance, up to about 1.2 m long, branching irregularly and with two or three spikes arising from each branchlet.
Leaf Description : markedly costapalmate, waxy/leathery, blue-green-grey to green-grey, 4'-6' long.
Seeds as diversely shaped as the fruits, basally attached, endosperm white, with a coconut flavour when young, with a central hollow cavity when ripe, germination remote-tubular, cotyledonary petiole buried up to 80 cm underground, eophyll linear-lanceolate, plicate.
Petiole/Leaf bases : 2' long, slightly channeled, armed with dark, hooked teeth , light yellow-green underneath to pale grey to peach colored near base, some scurf on sides and teeth, leaf bases split and often retained on trunk until maturity.
Flowers unisexual, 3-merous, male flowers with minute green bracts, calyx with tubular base and 3 acute, hooded lobes, corolla with a basal stalk and 3 overlapping, obovate and hooded lobes, stamens 6, on the base of the corolla lobes, female flowers much larger than male ones, pedicel short and wide, sepals 3, free, triangular, acute and leathery, petals 3, rounded, somewhat smaller than sepals, scarious, staminodes 6, ovary globose, 3-locular, but only 1 locule fertile, stigmas 3, sessile.

Stipules and bracts at base of peduncles very caducous, narrowly triangular-lanceolate and acute, 2-7 mm.
Flowers white with red staminal tube.
Young branchlets densely to very sparsely clothed with minute crisped puberulence, usually soon disappearing but sometimes persistent.
Flowers bisexual, regular, 5-merous, reddish white, sessile, subtended by up to 3 mm long bracteoles, calyx 2-4 mm long, with long tube toothed at apex, pubescent outside, corolla 6-9 mm long, with c. 5 mm long tube, pubescent outside, stamens numerous, 2-3 cm long, united into a reddish tube for most of their length, ovary superior, c. 1.5 mm long, gradually tapering into an up to 2 cm long style.
Leaves alternate, bipinnately compound with 2-3 pairs of pinnae, stipules awl-shaped, caducous, petiole 4-10 cm long, near the base of upper side with a sessile gland, rachis 2-13 cm long, pubescent but glabrescent, leaflets in 2-5 pairs per pinna, sessile, obliquely rhombic to elliptical, increasing in size from base to apex of pinna, up to 8 cm x 4 cm, obtuse to acute at apex, glabrous.
Growth and development     Seedlings develop quickly, and can reach 3 m tall after 2 years.
Trees are capable of growing rapidly and reached a bole diameter of 80 cm in secondary forest of 40 years old.
Inflorescence an axillary head on 2.5-4 cm long peduncle.
Seedling with epigeal germination, hypocotyl 4-4.5 cm long, epicotyl 1-3 cm long, cotyledons rounded to broadly elliptical, thick and fleshy, early caducous, first 2 leaves opposite, with one pair of pinnae.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Tectona grandis.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Odor - Mild, leathery odor during cutting.
The heartwood of the teak tree is dark brown to dark golden yellow in color, while the sapwood of this tree is white or light yellow in color, as such it is clearly distinguishable.
Teak trees feature: trunks with scaly gray to gray-brown bark topped by an open crown of spreading branches, large, rough, leathery, ovate-elliptic, green leaves which are covered by gray-green stellate hairs, fragrant, finely-pubescent, white flowers which bloom in summer in large terminal panicles to 16" long, globose, finely pubescent fruits enclosed in egg-shaped calyxes which mature from September to December, and dark yellow trunk wood which turns an attractive deep brown when exposed to sunlight and air.
The fruits of the tree are yellow when young and brown as they mature, they start growing in the month of September and ripe from November to January and then gradually fall from the tree.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

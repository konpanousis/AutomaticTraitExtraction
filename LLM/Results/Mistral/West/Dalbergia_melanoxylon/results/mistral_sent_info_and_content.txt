We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Dalbergia melanoxylon.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The fruit is a pod 3-7 cm long, containing one to two seeds.
Flowers are very small, white, pea-shaped, sweetly scented, produced in branched clusters arising at nodes along the branches, in early summer.
It is either a multi-trunked shrub or a single-trunked tree 5 to 10 m tall, occasionally reaching up to 12 m under optimal conditions and develops an irregular or rounded crown of short, twisted branches armed with sharp spines.
These trees are small and heavily branched, the trunks are seldom straight and many stems may be present, the rough bark is grey with many fissures, and the branches have small spines.
Pod 1-3-seeded, 2.5-7 x 1-1.8 cm, thin, stiff, conspicuously reticulate over the seeds.
Trees are slow growing, although the plant may reach about 3 m in 10 years, They take up to 100 years to produce a trunk with enough heartwood worth harvesting.
A small tree up to 20 ft. high, much-branched, glabrous, armed with woody spines which are the hardened tips of short branches often bearing leaves and flowers.
The leaves are deciduous in the dry season, alternate, 622 cm long, pinnate, with 6-9 alternately arranged leaflets.
Gillet JB, Polhill RM and Verdourt B, 1971.
They are covered at first with short crisp hairs, and are usually glabrous.
They tend to be papery, glabrous, and laxly and rather diffusely veined, with one or two seeds.
Leaves are up to 22 centimetres long and carry small, oval-shaped leaflets.
Flowers bisexual, papilionaceous, 4-6 mm long, almost sessile, calyx campanulate, 2-3 mm long, lobes shorter than tube, lower lobe longest, upper lobes fused, corolla whitish, with obovate standard and clawed wings and keel, stamens usually 9, fused into a tube, but free in upper part, ovary superior, with distinct stipe at base, style short.
Stamens usually 9, united or variously divided.
Branchlets are clustered at the nodes.
The dense, lustrous wood ranges in colour from reddish to pure black.
The heartwood is purplish black, sometimes darker towards the outside, with light streaks and not always uniform in color.
Ovary 2-4-ovulate, puberulous, style short, oblique, stipe c.1.5 mm long.
It is often multi-stemmed and much-branched, forming a low, irregularly shaped crown.
Fruit is a small, brown to khaki-coloured, flattened, thin, papery pod, not splitting, with a slight swelling where there is a seed.
Some grow out, while others are short and spine tipped.
Inflorescence a terminal or axillary panicle 2-12 cm long, laxly branched, short-hairy to almost glabrous, many-flowered.

D.P. Gwaze Title Bark Caption Pale-grey to greyish-brown bark of D. melanoxylon, smooth and flaking in long, narrow strips.
Branchlets clustered at the nodes, some growing out, others relatively short and spine-tipped, covered at first with short crisped hairs, but usually soon glabrescent.
Spiny shrub or tree, up to 5-12 m. tall, typically several-stemmed and much branched to form a low irregularly shaped crown, bark grey, ultimately rough and fissured or flaking, heartwood purplish-brown to black.
Description     Deciduous spiny shrub or small tree up to 12 m tall, often several-stemmed and much-branched, bole usually short, branchless for up to 2 m, often gnarled and fluted, up to 50 cm in diameter, bark surface whitish to pale grey or greyish brown, thin, smooth but becoming rough and fissured or flaking, inner bark orange-pink, crown irregular, open, young branches clustered at the nodes, some growing out and others remaining short and spine-tipped, initially short-hairy but soon glabrescent, whitish grey.
Morphology A small tree up to 20 ft. high, much-branched, glabrous, armed with woody spines which are the hardened tips of short branches often bearing leaves and flowers Provided by:.
The bark is pale grey to yellow-brown, smooth on young trees, becoming flaking with age.
The stems are often crooked.
The inflorescences develop just before or together with new flushes of leaves.
Bole length occasionally reaches up to 3.6 m, but normally ranges from 1.2 to 1.8 m. Average diameter at breast height at maturity is less than 38 cm, although trees have been found with a dbh of more than 60 cm.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

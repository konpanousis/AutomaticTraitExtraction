The fruit is a pod 3-7 cm long, containing one to two seeds.
Flowers are very small, white, pea-shaped, sweetly scented, produced in branched clusters arising at nodes along the branches, in early summer.
It is either a multi-trunked shrub or a single-trunked tree 5 to 10 m tall, occasionally reaching up to 12 m under optimal conditions and develops an irregular or rounded crown of short, twisted branches armed with sharp spines.
These trees are small and heavily branched, the trunks are seldom straight and many stems may be present, the rough bark is grey with many fissures, and the branches have small spines.
Pod 1-3-seeded, 2.5-7 x 1-1.8 cm, thin, stiff, conspicuously reticulate over the seeds.
Trees are slow growing, although the plant may reach about 3 m in 10 years, They take up to 100 years to produce a trunk with enough heartwood worth harvesting.

Branchlets clustered at the nodes, some growing out, others relatively short and spine-tipped, covered at first with short crisped hairs, but usually soon glabrescent.
Spiny shrub or tree, up to 5-12 m. tall, typically several-stemmed and much branched to form a low irregularly shaped crown, bark grey, ultimately rough and fissured or flaking, heartwood purplish-brown to black.
Description     Deciduous spiny shrub or small tree up to 12 m tall, often several-stemmed and much-branched, bole usually short, branchless for up to 2 m, often gnarled and fluted, up to 50 cm in diameter, bark surface whitish to pale grey or greyish brown, thin, smooth but becoming rough and fissured or flaking, inner bark orange-pink, crown irregular, open, young branches clustered at the nodes, some growing out and others remaining short and spine-tipped, initially short-hairy but soon glabrescent, whitish grey.

The bark is pale grey to yellow-brown, smooth on young trees, becoming flaking with age.
The stems are often crooked.
The inflorescences develop just before or together with new flushes of leaves.
Bole length occasionally reaches up to 3.6 m, but normally ranges from 1.2 to 1.8 m. Average diameter at breast height at maturity is less than 38 cm, although trees have been found with a dbh of more than 60 cm.

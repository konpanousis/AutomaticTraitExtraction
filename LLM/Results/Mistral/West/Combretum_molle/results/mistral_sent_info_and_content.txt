We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Combretum molle.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Combretum molle is a small to medium, quick growing deciduous tree that will attract birds as well.
The 4-winged fruit dries to a golden reddish-brown and remain on the tree into the following flowering season.
Bark grey and smooth when young, grey-brown to almost black, rough and flaking when older, twigs often with reddish hairs.
Velvet bush willow is a small to medium-sized evergreen deciduous trees that grows up to 13 m high, with rounded crown.
Velvety bush willow is a tree of the bush and savanna regions of Africa, often occurring on ant-hills, in semi-evergreen thickets and frequently associated with quartzite formations.
Deciduous â€“ Sheds Its Leaves Annually.
The greenish-yellow flowers are heavily scented.
The large, soft and velvety leaves turn bronze in autumn.
Combretum molle , the velvet bushwillow , is a medium to large tree species in the genus Combretum found in western, eastern and southern Africa.
The trunk is crooked or leaning, occasionally swollen at the base, up to 30 cm in diameter.
This fast-growing deciduous tree can reach a mature height of 4 to 13m when growing conditions are conducive.
The leaves are simple, opposite, densely covered by velvety hairs when immature and smoother when mature.
Flowers in dense axillary spikes, greenish yellow, strongly scented.
Branching is heavy and drooping, giving a rounded or flat-rounded, sometimes oval, crown.
The leaves are also oval to round and arranged in a opposite manner.
It may be evergreen or deciduous and yields a gum.
Young leaves are attractive with light pink or orange colour.
Pratt DS, Kaplan MM.
P, Picard J, Eloff JN.
The flowers are in dense axillary spikes with greenish yellow colour, strongly scented and attractive to bees and other insects.
It has grey bark when still young and this becomes grey-brown or almost black when older.
During germination two strands joined at their tips emerge from the fruit and carry the fused tip below the ground.
The fruit is four-winged, about 20 mm in diameter, light green with reddish shade which turns red-brown when dry.
A multi-stemmed tree with a dense crown.
Fruit 4-winged, 1.5-2 cm in diameter, yellowish green, drying to reddish brown.
The bark is dark-grey, rough and fissured.
When the cotyledon stalks cease to grow, the plumule develops below the ground and grows to the surface forming a shoot with leaves, while a true radical develops under ground.
Fruits are yellowish-green flushed with red, drying to golden reddish-brown, borne abundantly, some old fruits remaining on the tree into the next flowering season, 4-winged, the wings pale yellow-brown, rounded, with shallow notches at top and bottom.
Flowers appear from Sept to Nov.
Leaves broadly elliptic, covered in grey velvety hairs on both surfaces, venation distinctly sunken above.
Individual flowers are small on bare branches, pale cream or greenish-yellow, sometimes with a reddish tinge, heavily scented, borne singly in the axils of the leaves, in dense, axillary, often branched spikes, 4-9 cm long.
The bark of this tree is dark grey to black, rough and fissured into blocks that occasionally flake off.
Its leaves are light pink or orange and velvety when young becoming dark green and smoother with maturity.
Height: 13m Spread: 4-6m.
Small to medium-sized deciduous tree.
Bisexual flower on same the tree.
The short-stalked flowers are borne on a central stalk 3-7 cm long.
Native to areas which receive summer rainfall, the velvet bushwillow is a single trunked tree characterised with spreading branches that form a moderately dense, rounded to irregular canopy.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Blighia sapida.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Under favourable conditions, Ackee trees may attain heights up to 25 m , though are more typically 10 to 15 m tall with a straight, stout trunk supporting a densely leafy rounded crown.
The calyx is five- parted and light green, the five petals are cream and a nectary disc is present at the base.
Each flower has five greenish - white petals , which are fragrant.

Initially green, it turns to a red or to a yellow-orange colour at maturity.

This large tropical tree has pinnately compound leaves with 6 - 10 ovate leaflets, with entire margins.
Small five-petaled flowers in sessile cymes typically bloom biannually but occasionally more often.
The flowers are fragrant, small, white and produced in drooping pannicles.
Each leaflet is 8-12 centimetres long and 5-8 centimetres wide.
Leaves, upper and lower surface.
Each pinnate compound leaf has 6-10 oblong to obovate leaflets.
When ripe, each chamber splits to reveal three shiny seeds, each seed having a white fleshy aril at the base.
The fruit is a fleshy pyriform, dehiscent capsule, more or less tri-lobed, 7-10 cm long and 4-5 cm broad, of yellow suffused with glossy red colour, which when ripe opens longitudinally in three sections exposing three flesh arils reniform, of cream colour, 3-4,5 cm long and about 3 cm broad, and 1-3 globose, black and glossy, seeds.
Fruit: Showy, Edible.
The fruit is pear-shaped and has 3 lobes.
Leaf with the leaflets in pairs Arils with seed attached Use After removing and discarding the seed, the arils are cleaned of any reddish membrane, leaving only the soft yellow or cream-coloured flesh.
Fruit development takes 50-60 days from fruit set to open capsule stage , with fruit doubling in size during the first 14-21 days.
Bisexual and male flowers, borne together in simple racemes 3 to 7 in long, are fragrant, 5 petalled, white and hairy.
Decals en skins.
The fruit is yellow, more or less flushed with bright-scarlet.
It measures 6-10 cm in length.
Ripe seeds with their arils.
B. sapida is about 25m high and 2.5m in girth, with a heavy evergreen crown.
The tree has a moderately dense round to oval crown and stiff branches.
Part of ripe fruit, two seeds with their arils still attached.
Broadleaved Perennial Seed propagated Tree Vegetatively propagated Woody.
Its bark is gray and nearly smooth.
When it ripens, it turns from green to a bright red to yellow-orange, and splits open to reveal three large, shiny black seeds, each partly surrounded by soft, creamy or spongy, white to yellow flesh - the aril having a nut-like flavor and texture of scrambled eggs.

The leaves, on a 0,5-2,5 cm long petiole, are alternate, paripinnate, up to about 30 cm long, composed by 3-5 pairs of leaflets from oblong to elliptic with entire or slightly wavy margin and pointed apex, 6-18 cm long and 4-8 cm broad, of glossy green colour on the upper page, pale below.
The bark is smooth to slightly rough, grey to pale brown, with lenticels in horizontal lines.
Bloom Description: Greenish white.
It is a medium to large tree that can reach 8-24 m in height and 60-80 cm in trunk diameter.
The fruit is a leathery, pear shaped, more or less distinctly 3-lobed capsule 2 3/4 to 4 in long.
The leaves are bright-green and glossy on the upper surface, dull and paler and finely hairy on the veins on the under side.
Flowers are greenish white and fragrant.
The evergreen , alternate leaves are compound with 3 to 5 pairs of oblong, obovate-oblong, or elliptic leaflets, 6 to 12 in long, rounded at the base, short-pointed at the apex.
Raw arils after pods allowed to open naturally.
The heartwood is pale gold- to orange-brown.
Mature trees have smooth gray bark.
The inflorescences are axillar hanging racemes 5-18 cm long with tiny perfumed flowers, bisexual and also male on the same plant, with white or cream corolla with 5 ovate-lanceolate petals, 0,4 cm long, villous, and 8 stamina 0,5 cm long.
The sapwood is white or light greenish-brown.
Flowers are small and insignificant, cream-coloured, either bi-sexual or male and held in branched clusters arising at the ends of the branches, though the leaves may partly obscure them.
Seeds The seeds are about 1 cm in diameter, almost round, black,hard, shiny and very poisonous.
The tree, reaching 33 to 40 ft , is rather hand some, usually with a short trunk to 6 ft in circumference, and a dense crown of spreading branches.
The pear-shaped fruit is a fleshy, dehiscent, usually three-lobed capsule with a leathery skin.
Alles in Flms.
They have a thick fibrous shell that splits at the base when mature, separating into three segments, each shielding a soft, pale yellow or creamy-white aril with a glossy black seed attached.
The inflorescences are fragrant , up to 20 cm long, with unisexual flowers that bloom during warm months.
The bark is pale grey and smooth.
Type: Broadleaf evergreen.
The ripe capsules split open to expose 3 glossy black seeds, each attached to a fleshy white to yellow aril.
Leaflets are opposite or sub-opposite, elliptical to oblong-obovate and shortly acuminate.
The Blighia sapida K.D.Koenig is an evergreen tree, up to about 15 m tall, with greyish or pale brown smooth bark and thick crown.
The fruits are three lobed, bell-shaped, 3 - 4 in.
At each flowering, the proportion of hermaphrodite to male flowers varies.
The fruit typically weighs 100-200 grams.
Leaves are large and compound, consisting of glossy green oval leaflets, each 12 to 20 cm long and arranged in pairs along the length.
Leaves glabrate and lustrous above, slightly hairy below at least on the midrib.
Ackee is an evergreen tree that grows about 10 metres tall, with a short trunk and a dense crown.
At maturity the three lobes split longitudinally apart, with each showing a partially embedded seed in a kidney-shaped, cream-coloured, fleshy, glossy aril  that is waxy in texture, attached to shiny black seeds.
When it is fully mature, it splits open revealing 3 cream-colored, fleshy, glossy arils, crisp, somewhat nutty-flavored, attached to the large, black, nearly round, smooth, hard, shining seeds 3 in number, often 1 or 2 may be aborted.
Pear-shaped fruits are straw colored to magenta red.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Steganotaenia araliacea.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Steganotaenia araliacea variation araliacea flowering.
Small glabrous deciduous tree or shrub, from c. 2-10 m. high, with ascending branches, bark grey formed with a small rectangular pattern, upper stem corky, pale grey, leaves normally absent at flowering and fruiting times.
Fruits hang in dense pale-green clusters from stem-tips, later as they dry, turned pale creamy brown.
Flowers usually appearing before the leaves, flowering branchlets in clusters of mostly ± 6-11 at the tips of young twigs, ± 6-15 cm.
Leaves spirally arranged, crowded near the ends of branches, imparipinnate with 2-3 pairs of leaflets and a terminal leaflet, leaflets ovate, 3-5 cm long, apex tapering to a fine point, margin strongly dentate, the teeth ending in a hair-like tip , petiole broadened at the base, clasping the stem.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.
The pale green leaves with sharply toothed margins have a hair-like point.
Yellow green to grey bark peels of in papery strips or rectangles and becomes rough and cracking in older trees.
Leaflet shape is broadly ovate or elliptic and slightly oblique.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

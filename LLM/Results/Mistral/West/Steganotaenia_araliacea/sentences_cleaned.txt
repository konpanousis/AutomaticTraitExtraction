Steganotaenia araliacea is a small, aromatic, deciduous tree that grows to a height of 2 - 7 m.
The trunk may reach a diameter of 25 cm.
The inconspicuous small, tightly bunched greenish white flowers appear from August to October, followed by papery seeds.
The small flowers are densely clustered, appearing before the leaves in late winter and throughout spring, somewhat similar to those of carrots , a relative in the Apiaceae family.
Calyx-lobes c. 0.5 mm long.
Steganotaenia araliacea variation araliacea flowering.
Small glabrous deciduous tree or shrub, from c. 2-10 m. high, with ascending branches, bark grey formed with a small rectangular pattern, upper stem corky, pale grey, leaves normally absent at flowering and fruiting times.
Fruits hang in dense pale-green clusters from stem-tips, later as they dry, turned pale creamy brown.
Flowers usually appearing before the leaves, flowering branchlets in clusters of mostly ± 6-11 at the tips of young twigs, ± 6-15 cm.
Leaves spirally arranged, crowded near the ends of branches, imparipinnate with 2-3 pairs of leaflets and a terminal leaflet, leaflets ovate, 3-5 cm long, apex tapering to a fine point, margin strongly dentate, the teeth ending in a hair-like tip , petiole broadened at the base, clasping the stem.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.
The pale green leaves with sharply toothed margins have a hair-like point.
Yellow green to grey bark peels of in papery strips or rectangles and becomes rough and cracking in older trees.
Leaflet shape is broadly ovate or elliptic and slightly oblique.

Steganotaenia araliacea variation araliacea leaves.
The thinly textured blades are fresh green, yellowish green or bright green on both surfaces, slightly paler below and hairless.
Fruit are produced in messy clusters from October to November and are heart-shaped, splitting in two to release seeds.
Fruits in messy clusters, flattened, 7-12 mm, heart-shaped, splitting in 2.
Bark greenish, corky, peeling in papery strips, all parts with a strong carrot smell.
Mericarps with 3 distinct dorsal ribs which may occasionally be slightly winged.
Main umbels with 8-15 robust rays of 3-4.5 cm.
It is a small savannah tree, growing to a height of between 2 and 7 m.  Sparsely branched, the tree has a pale grey-green trunk which is very noticeable during the winter months.
Calyx-teeth broadly deltoid, acute, ± 0.5 mm.
Leaves clustered at the tip of younger twigs and more scattered along some old wood, imparipinnate with 3-4 pairs of leaflets, narrowly or broadly oblong in outline, up to ± 45 x 25 cm.
Steganotaenia araliacea variation araliacea , commonly known as the carrot tree or popgun tree , is a deciduous shrub or small, erect or crooked-stemmed tree with irregularly shaped crown from 2 m to 10 m in height.
Peduncles often with up to 3 smaller lateral umbels in addition to the central one, and these may be composed of male flowers only.
Leaflet stalks, the petiolules are from 5 mm to 10 mm long.
The main stem of the Carrot tree is upright and can be straight or crooked with noticeably thick twigs and branches.
The calyx is toothed, while the petals have long, incurving tips, keeled inside.
Carpophore entire lying in a groove in the otherwise flat inner surface of the mericarp.
Vittae rudimentary to obsolete.
Fruit 12-13 x 6-8 mm., usually narrowly obovate, very strongly dorsally compressed, with well-developed lateral wings as wide as the seed-containing part.
The leaf structure is imparipinnate, formed by only two to four, widely spaced leaflet pairs on the yellow-green, hairless rachis, as well as a terminal one.
Leaflets 3.5-12 x 2-7 cm., in 3-4 pairs plus a terminal one, lanceolate to narrowly lanceolate, rarely nearly circular, borne on short petiolules or sessile.
The inflorescences of Steganotaenia araliacea variation araliacea are compound stem-tip umbels, collectively up to 20 cm in diameter.
Apex narrowly acute with a prolonged stiff mucro, base rounded to subcuneate, margin regularly serrate, the tips of the teeth produced as long stiff bristles.

Lonchocarpus is a plant genus in the legume family.
Corolla much longer than calyx, white, pink or purplish, sometimes with yellow markings on the standard, glabrous or with scattered hairs in section Paniculati, elsewhere more commonly conspicuously silky-hairy at least on the standard outside, standard ovate, obovate or suborbicular, sometimes auriculate and/or with calluses at base of the blade, wings adhering to the keel and of subequal length in African species Provided by:.

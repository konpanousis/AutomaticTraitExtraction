We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Ficus polita.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:

Inside, the tree can remain relatively short with ample pruning reaching a maximum height of 10 feet.
All figs present a white to yellowish latex , some in copious quantities, the twig shows paired stipules -or circular scars if the stipules have fallen off, the lateral veins at the base of the leaf are steep, forming a tighter angle with the midrib than the other lateral veins, a feature referred to as "triveined".

Nearly half of fig species are gynodioecious, and therefore have some plants with inflorescences with long styled pistillate flowers, and other plants with staminate flowers mixed with short styled pistillate flowers.

The alternate leaves are broadly ovate, shiny bright green above and light green beneath.
Its most distinguishable characteristic is the chubby trunk that resembles a pot belly.
The tree is semi-green, meaning old leaves fall off at a certain point giving room for new ones to grow.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

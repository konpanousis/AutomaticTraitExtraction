We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Euphorbia balsamifera.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:

Description: Euphorbia balsamifera forms dichotomously branched, rounded shrub of variable height from very short bushes with creeping stems exposed to the wind hardly rising above the ground to small trees 1 to 3 meters tall.
The "involucre" in the genus Euphorbia is not to be confused with the "involucre" in family Asteraceae members, which is a collection of bracts called phyllaries , which surround and encase the unopened flower head, then support the receptacle under it after the flower head opens.
Individuals can grow to 1.5 m.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

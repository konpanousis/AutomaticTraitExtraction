Perennial Seed propagated Shrub Woody.
At maturity, the pods turn from green to brown and break into buoyant, single-seeded segments.
M. pigra is a spreading, multi-stemmed, thorny shrub usually up to 2 m tall, but occasionally up to 6 m, with a maximum lifespan of about 5 years.
One to three of these small flower clusters are produced on stalks 2-7 cm long, emanating from each upper leaf fork.
The seeds are flattened, elliptic to oblong in outline, greenish-brown to brown in color and approximately ½ inch long.
The spherical inflorescences, containing up to 100 flowers, last one day.
This is a sprawling, multi-branched shrub that grows 10 to 20 feet high.
Each flower has four inconspicuous petals and eight prominent stamens, which may be light pink, lilac or white in color.
The stems are covered with short, stiff, appressed hairs, as well as scattered, recurved prickles to ½ inch long.
They consist of several pairs of branchlets , each about 5 cm long and bearing numerous pairs of small leaflets.
The fruits ripen in about 3 months and, when mature, fragment into indehiscent one-seeded segments.

Flowers are mauve or pink, born in tight, subglobose pedunculate heads 1 cm in diameter, each containing approximately 100 flowers.
Embryo investing, cotyledons much longer than radicle.
M. pudica is a smaller plant, with a more low-growing habit , that has few-branched leaves.
The pods are borne in clusters , are straight or slightly curved, and are initially green in colour.
It can be distinguished from Mimosa pudica by its large size, large pods and leaves, which have 6 to 16 pairs of pinnae as opposed to 1 to 2 pairs on Mimosa pudica leaves.
Flowers are mauve or pink, in tight, subglobose pedunculate heads 1 cm in diameter, each containing approximately 100 flowers.
At maturity narrow 1-seeded fruit segments split transversely and separate from the persistent sutures.
The fruits ripen in about 3 months and when mature, they fragment into indehiscent 8 to 24 one-seeded segments.
They contain between 8 and 24 seeds.

Pleurogram open, distinctly wide and closely following margin, pleurograms on each face nearly connected at base.
Dull, semiglossy, smooth.
Mimosa pigra At maturity, the fruit breaks into single- seeded segments covered in golden bristles, which aid in dispersal.
The seeds have a hard, impermeable coat which allows them to remain dormant for many years, forming large seed banks until they are exposed to conditions optimal for germination.
The tiny flowers are densely arranged in globular heads about ½ inch wide.
It produces relatively large pods that contain many one-seeded segments.

The leaves are bright green and bipinnate , consisting of a central prickly rachis 20 to 25 cm long with up to 16 pairs of pinnae 5 cm long, each divided into pairs of leaflets 3 to 8 mm long.
These leaves often have small prickles present along their main axis.

Each flower head produces a cluster of 10 to 20 seedpods, which then mature and break into segments, each containing an oblong shaped seed.
Mimosa pigra The inflorescence is a spherical head of tiny flowers that may be pinkish-white, pink or mauve/lilac in color.
Each seed is about 5 x 2.4 mm and weighs 0.09 mg.

The flowers are pale pink or mauve and cream in colour and arranged in fluffy, globular clusters.
The leaflets are elongated in shape and stalkless.
Ripe seeds are light brown to brown or olive green.

M. invisa is also a densely spiny shrub, much larger than M. pudica , differing from M. pigra in having narrow pods up to 5 mm wide, compared with at least 1 cm in M. pigra.
The plant is evergreen and bears bipinnate, sensitive leaves, up to 18 cm in length.
Individual flowers have four tiny sepals , four inconspicuous petals , and eight prominent pinkish stamens that give the flower clusters their fluffy appearance.
The stem is greenish in young plants but becomes woody as the plant matures.

Description Mimosa pigra is an upright prickly shrub or small tree.
The flat pods of M. pigra are hairy and up to 15 cm long and clustered at the stem tips.
The species is androdioecious with both male and hermaphrodite flowers bearing eight short and long stamens.
The inflorescences are mostly borne in the distal leaf axils.
The twice-compound leaves are alternately arranged along the stems and borne on stalks.
The seeds are light brown, brown or greenish-brown in colour, elongated in shape, and somewhat flattened.
The inflorescences, containing up to 100 flowers, are spherical and pink.
There are solitary, vertical prickles at the intersection of opposing pinnae and paired horizontal prickles on the rachis between each pair of pinnae.
Description Mimosa pigra is a leguminous shrub, which can reach up to 6m in height.
The leaves are bright green and bipinnate , consisting of a central prickly rachis 20 to 25 cm long with up to 16 pairs of pinnae 5 cm long, each divided into pairs of leaflets 3 to 8
M. pudica also differs in being very much less robust, rarely over 0.5-1 m high.
The fruit is an elongated and flattened pod that is covered in bristly hairs.

Deciduous tree up to 7.5-18 m. tall, generally with a straight trunk and spreading crown, bark usually rough, grey-brown, slash yellowish, exuding red gum.
The ovate, flattened fruits are pale creamy-brown with a wing surrounding the seed chamber, which holds one, rarely two seeds.
The fruits are 4.5-6.5 cm long and 2-3 cm wide, including the wing.
Fruit an obovate-elliptical, flattened, indehiscent pod 3-5.5 cm long, on a stipe up to 1 cm long and with a papery, wavy wing, glabrous, straw-coloured to greyish or yellowish brown, 1-seeded.
Flowers 15-18 mm long, pedicels rather slender, 10-18 mm long.
Large tree with characteristic multiple bole.
Flowers in long lax axillary and terminal sprays, pale yellow, sweetly scented.
They flower at the end of the dry season, just before new leaves develop, or flowers appear together with young leaves.
Leaves imparipinnate with up to 4 pairs of leaflets and a terminal leaflet, leaflets ovate, oblong to somewhat obovate, small for the genus, usually c. 3 x 2 cm, light green, asymmetric at the apex and base, margin entire.
Bark pale grey, mottled, flaking, branchlets sometimes spine-tipped.
The heartwood is creamy white and indistinctly demarcated from the sapwood.
The grain is straight or interlocked, texture moderately fine.
Deciduous tree, often branched from the base, up to 12 m tall, crown spreading or irregular, bark greyish, flaking off in plates.
The flowers are the shape of pea-flowers, with a five-toothed calyx and a corolla with five crinkly petals.
Perennial, Not climbing, Tree.
The spindly, hairless petiole is 10-20 cm long.
Racemes in axils of current and fallen leaves, 6-20 cm.

Pod 1-seeded, 3-4 x 2.5-5 cm, obovate or oblong-obovate, often somewhat incurved, narrowly winged, apex rounded, base obtuse or cuneate, veined or smooth over the seed, style-base at the apex or nearly so.
Seed kidney-shaped to oblong, flat to slightly thickened, c. 7 mm x 3 mm, smooth, brown.
Inflorescence an axillary raceme 6-12 cm long, slightly hairy.
The bark is dark grey-brown and fissured or flaky, and exudes a red, sticky resin when cut.
Bark light grey smooth flaking off in irregular large suborbicular or subelliptic thin pieces exposing light yellowish suface.
Calyx 3.5-5 mm long, thinly appressed-pubescent outside, ciliolate on the teeth-margin, teeth obtuse to acute.
Fruit ± semi-orbicular, with a relatively narrow coriaceous wing produced slightly to the subterminal style-base and partially decurrent on to the 1-2 cm.
Botany     Deciduous shrub or small tree up to 12 m tall, bole straight and cylindrical or low-branched, up to 70 cm in diameter, bark surface pale grey to dark brown, smooth to fissured or scaly, inner bark brown, mottled with yellow and purplish red, exuding a reddish gum on slashing, crown narrow, dense, twigs short-hairy when young.
The leaflets are fresh grassy green, glossy above, but much paler below.
Fruit a small flattened oval pod, up to 5 x 3 cm, asymmetric at the apex, markedly swollen over the single seed, surrounded by a thick membranous wing.

The stipules are linear, 2-3 mm long and fall off early.
Fruits take about 3 months to mature.
Standard circular, 12-15 mm in diameter, claw c.3.5 mm long, wings nearly as long as the standard, auricle rounded, claw c.4 mm long, keel petals shorter than the wings, free, dorsally slightly overlapping.
Flowers:  The inflorescences are produced on leafy branches and are composed of light yellow, sweetly-scented flowers on long stalks.
Flowering time very brief, lasting only a few days.
Ovary 2-3-ovulate, appressed-pilose on the sutures, style 3-4 mm long, glabrous, stipe short, puberulous.
Calyx shortly lobed, 4-6 mm.
The leaflets are orbicular, elliptic or ovate, 3-8 cm long and 1.5-5 cm wide.
Overview:  Pterocarpus lucens varies from being a low-branching, deciduous shrub, to a full tree up to 18 m tall, with a trunk diameter up to 80 cm.
The wind-dispersed, winged fruits remain on the tree for a long time after maturity.
The leaves are compound, 10-28 cm long, with up to 11 leaflets.
Stamens 9 fused, the upper one free for much of its length.

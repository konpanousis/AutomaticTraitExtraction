We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Pterocarpus lucens.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Young parts appressed-pubescent, soon glabrous, branchlets glabrous, bark reddish-brown.
Deciduous tree up to 7.5-18 m. tall, generally with a straight trunk and spreading crown, bark usually rough, grey-brown, slash yellowish, exuding red gum.
The ovate, flattened fruits are pale creamy-brown with a wing surrounding the seed chamber, which holds one, rarely two seeds.
The fruits are 4.5-6.5 cm long and 2-3 cm wide, including the wing.
Fruit an obovate-elliptical, flattened, indehiscent pod 3-5.5 cm long, on a stipe up to 1 cm long and with a papery, wavy wing, glabrous, straw-coloured to greyish or yellowish brown, 1-seeded.
Flowers 15-18 mm long, pedicels rather slender, 10-18 mm long.
Large tree with characteristic multiple bole.
Flowers in long lax axillary and terminal sprays, pale yellow, sweetly scented.
They flower at the end of the dry season, just before new leaves develop, or flowers appear together with young leaves.
Leaves imparipinnate with up to 4 pairs of leaflets and a terminal leaflet, leaflets ovate, oblong to somewhat obovate, small for the genus, usually c. 3 x 2 cm, light green, asymmetric at the apex and base, margin entire.

Seed kidney-shaped to oblong, flat to slightly thickened, c. 7 mm x 3 mm, smooth, brown.
Inflorescence an axillary raceme 6-12 cm long, slightly hairy.

Calyx 3.5-5 mm long, thinly appressed-pubescent outside, ciliolate on the teeth-margin, teeth obtuse to acute.
Fruit ± semi-orbicular, with a relatively narrow coriaceous wing produced slightly to the subterminal style-base and partially decurrent on to the 1-2 cm.
Botany     Deciduous shrub or small tree up to 12 m tall, bole straight and cylindrical or low-branched, up to 70 cm in diameter, bark surface pale grey to dark brown, smooth to fissured or scaly, inner bark brown, mottled with yellow and purplish red, exuding a reddish gum on slashing, crown narrow, dense, twigs short-hairy when young.

The stipules are linear, 2-3 mm long and fall off early.
Fruits take about 3 months to mature.
Standard circular, 12-15 mm in diameter, claw c.3.5 mm long, wings nearly as long as the standard, auricle rounded, claw c.4 mm long, keel petals shorter than the wings, free, dorsally slightly overlapping.
Flowers:  The inflorescences are produced on leafy branches and are composed of light yellow, sweetly-scented flowers on long stalks.
Flowering time very brief, lasting only a few days.
Ovary 2-3-ovulate, appressed-pilose on the sutures, style 3-4 mm long, glabrous, stipe short, puberulous.
Calyx shortly lobed, 4-6 mm.
The leaflets are orbicular, elliptic or ovate, 3-8 cm long and 1.5-5 cm wide.
Overview:  Pterocarpus lucens varies from being a low-branching, deciduous shrub, to a full tree up to 18 m tall, with a trunk diameter up to 80 cm.
The wind-dispersed, winged fruits remain on the tree for a long time after maturity.
The leaves are compound, 10-28 cm long, with up to 11 leaflets.
Stamens 9 fused, the upper one free for much of its length.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

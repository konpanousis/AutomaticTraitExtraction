Leaf-blades elliptic-ovate, 1-3.5 x 0.7-2 cm, apically retuse or rounded, shortly mucronulate, basally cuneate, sparsely covered with medifixed hairs when young, petiole 4-7 mm long, covered with medifixed hairs.
Stamens up to about 20, 8-10 mm long.

Stamens are many, ovary on a gynophore, 1-celled.
The leaves are simple, entire and rarely reduced.
Petals oblong-elliptic, 5-8 mm long, pubescent mainly on the outside, villose at the base within.
Branches are armed with recurved stipular spines.
The spines on the Coast Zigzag Caper-bush are usually reduced or absent.
Stamens c. 8 on filaments up to 1.0 cm.
Coppice shoots of the two forms are practically indistinguishable and produce straight thorns and spreading hairs.
Leaves alternate, spirally arranged, lamina oblong or elliptic to lanceolate, tapering towards the apex, usually emarginate, mucronulate, usually broadly cuneate at the base, 2-5 cm long, 0.8-3 cm broad, with secondary veins longer than half the leaf and the first pair usually joining the primary vein at the base of the leaf blade, at first pubescent with appressed hairs, becoming glabrous, petiole 0.2-2 cm long, pubescent.
Ripe fruit not known.
Flowers in aphyllous racemes borne terminally on side branches or in the upper leaf-axils, or the lower flowers in the axils of reduced leaves, pedicels up to 8 mm.
The anterior sepal is usually saccate and the two adjoining petals are usually broader with a much more pronounced villose base.
Portion of a mature stem of C. f. variation zeyheri showing paired spines.
Gynophore 4-9 mm long, ovary ellipsoid, c. 1.5-2 mm long, with flattened-capitate stigma on a short style.
Sepals and petals are 4 in number and are free.
Leaves petiolate, blade generally narrowly lanceolate or elliptic, sometimes broadly so, 0.7-6 cm.
The flowers are whitish and produced on leafless side branchlets which resemble spikes or racemes.

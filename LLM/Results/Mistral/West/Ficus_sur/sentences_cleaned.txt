The short-stalked white fruit is 5-8 mm in diameter and turns yellowish pink when mature.
Family MORACEAE Genus Ficus Species sur SA Plant Number 50 Basionym Ficus sur.
The trunk can be fluted or multi-stemmed and the bark is smooth and grey on older specimens.
It produces masses of figs in dense, branched clusters along the main trunk and lower branches.
The female blue butterfly is usually bigger than the male, with a wing span of 33-41 mm, whereas the male-s wing span is 26-34 mm.
Ficus trichopoda  may grow as either a medium-sized tree or a shrub.
Various stages of developing figs occur along the same branch, resulting in eye-catching and unusual splashes of red, pink, green, purple and brown.

All figs present a white to yellowish latex , some in copious quantities, the twig shows paired stipules -or circular scars if the stipules have fallen off, the lateral veins at the base of the leaf are steep, forming a tighter angle with the midrib than the other lateral veins, a feature referred to as "triveined".
The bark of younger trees is smooth and pale greyish-white in colour, in contrast to the flaky, yellow bark of F. sycomorus.
Description     Medium-sized tree up to 30 m tall, with white latex present in all aerial parts, bole up to 150 cm in diameter, sometimes with buttresses, outer bark brownish to grey or whitish, inner bark greenish to pink, crown massive, spreading.

Large specimens develop a massive spreading crown, fluted trunks, and buttress roots.
Leaves arranged spirally, simple, shiny red when young, stipules 1-3.5 cm long, petiole 1-9 cm long, blade elliptical to ovate or oblong, sometimes nearly orbicular or lanceolate, 4-23 cm x 2-13 cm, base rounded, truncate or almost cordate, apex acuminate to acute, margin toothed to wavy or entire, papery to leathery, upper surface smooth, glabrous, lower surface hairy to glabrous, pinnately veined with 5-9 pairs of lateral veins.
In spring the new leaves flush the tree with a beautiful coppery colour.
When the male flowers have finished producing pollen, the fig ripens and becomes attractive to fruit-eating animals which disperse the seeds.
Drooping paniculate spurs with fig clusters.
It has a smooth, light grey bark and develops a large spreading crown with age.
Nearly half of fig species are gynodioecious, and therefore have some plants with inflorescences with long styled pistillate flowers, and other plants with staminate flowers mixed with short styled pistillate flowers.
The veins are conspicuous, yellowish white above and red below.
Fruit an ellipsoid to oblong-ovoid drupe 1.5-2 mm long, 1-seeded, developing within the fig.
The figs are slightly more flattened top and bottom than the common domestic fig, Ficus carica.
The many small flowers are unseen unless the fig is cut open.
It becomes darker in older trees.
The leaf stalk is ± 25 mm long.
Flowers unisexual, sessile, male flowers with 3-lobed perianth and 2-3 stamens, female flowers with 2-4 tepals, 1-celled ovary and short or long style.
The figs are 2-4 cm in diameter and acquire a rosy, speckled exterior when ripe.
Fig plants can be monoecious or gynodioecious.
Fruits are borne along the branchlets, in summer, August to May.
Large stipules cover the growth tip.
Size: 10 to 35m.
The stipule of Ficus religiosa.
Ficus superba variation henneana Corner.
With increasing age the bark becomes darker and rough.
Ficus sur is a fairly hardy, semi-deciduous, large tree with smooth grey bark.
The thin, leathery leaves are dark almost grey-green and paler green beneath which make the tree shimmer in the wind.
Ficus sur is a large, fast-growing, evergreen tree, reaching up to 35 m high, with large, oval, green leaves borne on a massive, spreading crown.
It is quite similar in appearance to the giant-leaved fig, F. lutea, but the latter has yellow figs, the veins and leaf stalks are yellow, and the apical bud has a silvery-coloured sheath.
The bark of the young branches appears smooth and is greyish, but turns dark grey and becomes rough as it matures.
Ficus sur , with the common names Cape fig and broom cluster fig , is a widespread Afrotropical species of cauliflorous fig.
Fresh foliage is a conspicuous red colour and the papery, 1 cm long stipules are soon dropped.
The white stipule contains a new leaf and a new stipule.
The leaves are simple with a glossy, dark green colour and the texture is thin and papery or slightly leathery.
The figs are 2-4 cm in diameter and acquire a rosy, speckled exterior when ripe.

The fruit typically has a bulbous shape with a small opening at the outward end that allows access to pollinators.
The copper-coloured new leaves contrast effectively against the older grey or grey-green leaves in spring and the leaf margins are lightly serrated and wavy.
The height is recorded as being between 12 and 25 m. It has a rounded, spreading crown and may spread further sideways by sending down aerial roots which become new stems.
The figs are carried on short or long drooping spurs which may emerge from surface roots, the trunk or especially from lower main branches.
Inflorescence a fig, the flowers enclosed within, figs on branched leafless branchlets up to 50-70 cm long on the trunk or older branches, or occasionally 1-2 together in the leaf axils, obovoid to globose, 1-4 cm in diameter, often stiped, glabrous to densely hairy, red to dark orange at maturity, peduncle 0.5-2 cm long.
Anatomy     Wood-anatomical description : Growth rings: 2: growth ring boundaries indistinct or absent.
The seed is small and swallowed together with the fruit by the many birds and mammals which greedily consume it.
The simple, leathery leaves, with a heart-shaped base, are pale green and have smooth margins.
The bark is mostly pale and smooth with some mottling.
The sheaths enfolding the apical buds and the leaf stalks are also red.
The genus Dorstenia , also in the fig family , exhibits similar tiny flowers arranged on a receptacle but in this case the receptacle is a more or less flat, open surface.
The grain is straight or interlocked, texture moderately coarse to coarse.
Ficus salicifolia is a tree that grows up to ± 10 m high in domestic gardens, but can reach a height of 20 m in its natural environment.

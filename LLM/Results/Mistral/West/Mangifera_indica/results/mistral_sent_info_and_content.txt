We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Mangifera indica.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Kochummen Trunk Mangifera indica , Trunk, bole and bark.
Armoured scales associated with temperate and subtropical fruit trees in Himachal Pradesh.
Leaf morphology is highly variable depending on cultivariation Leaves are spirally arranged, simple, young leaves are copper-coloured, turning to light then dark shiny green, petiole 1-12.5 cm long, with pulvinus at the base, blade variable in size and shape, usually narrowly elliptic to lanceolate, 12-38 x 2-13 cm, somewhat leathery, tapering at base, margin often undulate, apex acuminate, nerves 12-30 pairs, elevated on both surfaces.
It has long leaves that are pinkish when new.
There are five large, fleshy stamens, only one or two of them being fertile, the remaining stamens are sterile staminodes that are surmounted by a small gland.
Mangifera  contains most of the species and is characterized by its cushion-shaped papillose disc which is 4 or 5 lobed, partly or completely surrounding the ovary and with free stamen filaments.
The exocarp is thick and glandular.
Most of the flowers function as males by providing pollen, but some are bisexual and set fruit.
Noted as reaching 20-30m tall with a 20-30m spread and a trunk diameter of 60- 120cm after 50years  or so in its native habitat.
Leaves persist on the tree for 4-5 years before being shed.
Pyramid clusters of small yellow to pink flowers during spring.
Fruit shape varies, including elongate, oblong and ovate or intermediate forms involving two of these shapes.
Leaves.Leaves are produced in flushes of 10-12 new leaves, 1-3 times a year.
It can grow up to 15-30 metres tall with a similar crown width and a trunk circumference of more than 3.7 m.
The mango is an irregular, egg-shaped fruit which is a fleshy drupe.
Mature terminal branches bear pyramidal flower panicles that have several hundred white flowers that are about a 1/4 inch wide when open.
Mango trees are deep-rooted, symmetrical evergreens that attain heights of 90 feet and widths of 80 feet.
The Mango inflorescence is a terminal compose thirsoid and are glabrous or pubescent.
Perennial Seed propagated Tree.
The flesh of ripe mangos is pale yellow to orange.

Large elliptical leaves of Mangifera indica - Mango.
The pistil aborts in male flowers.
With the onset of bearing, the number of flushes is reduced to two or three, including the dry-season flush which coincides with flowering.
The inflorescence is rigid and erect, up to 30 cm long, and is widely branched, usually tertiary, although the final branch is always cymose.

The fruit is fleshy and contains a single flat stone, surrounded by a green, yellow, orange juicy sweet pulp.

Limus  consists of 11 species and is characterized by the cylindrical disc which is located at the base of the ovary in bisexual flowers and which is neither lobed nor papillose and contains united stamen filaments.
Kochummen Habit Mangifera indica , Mature tree in habit.
The panicles consist of male and perfect hermaphrodite flowers, with a varying sex ratio.
Tree with unripe fruits.
Fruits are either golen or green with a red blush and weigh in around 300 - 350gs when ripe.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Kigelia africana.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The flowers are short-lived, lasting only one day.
Kigelia Africana, otherwise known as a -sausage tree,- is a flowering plant that is indigenous to Tropical Africa and grows poisonous fruit that resembles very large cucumbers or sausages inside casings.
The short, squat trunk has light brown, sometimes flaky bark and supports a dense rounded to spreading crown of leathery, slightly glossy foliage.
This strange, semi-deciduous tree bears beautiful, bell-like, purple-red flowers.
The fruit pulp is fibrous, containing many seeds.
Leaves opposite or in whorls of 3, imparipinnate, crowded towards the tips of the branches, leaflets 5-11, opposite, sessile or subsessile except the terminal one with petiolule 1-4 cm long, leaflet lamina 3.5-20 x 2.5-11 cm, ovate-elliptic, apex obtuse, broadly tapering to rounded or retuse, base rounded to cuneate, slightly to strongly asymmetric except in the terminal leaflet which is symmetric, glabrous to more or less hairy on both surfaces, margins entire, serrate or toothed and sometimes conspicuously wavy, lateral nerves impressed above and prominent below, petiole 3.5-15 cm long, rhachis sulcate above, terete below.
Wintersluiting tot half februari.
This large deciduous tree grows to 18m and it is very fast growing.
It is very distinctive and easily recognized by its pendulous inflorescences with large maroon flowers and its hanging fruits, which are sausage-shaped and 40 cm long or more.
Well-shaped and reasonably robust, the low-branching, wild peach has smooth, pale grey bark that becomes rough with age.
The sausage tree produces long open sprays of large wrinkled maroon or dark red trumpet-shaped flowers that are velvety on the inside and that virtually overflow with nectar.
The following description is from Diniz : Tree to 25 m tall with usually broad, rounded crown.
Fruit cylindrical, sausage-shaped, up to 1 m long and 18 cm in diameter, indehiscent, pendulous from a long peduncle, wood-walled with a fibrous pulp, greyish-brown, lenticellate when young, seeds numerous, thick, wingless, embedded in pulp, 10 x 7 mm.
The genus is distinctive among the Bignoniaceae for its giant, sausage-like, indehiscent fruits which can weigh up to 10 kg.
The chromosome number of K. africana is 2n =40.
Kigelia Africana is a multipurpose medicinal plant with many attributes and considerable potentials.
The flowers hang down from branches on long flexible stems.
The fruit is a woody berry from 30 to 99 cm long and up to 18 cm in diameter, but 20 cm has been reported.
The trunk has light brown sometimes flaky bark and supports a dense rounded to spreading crown of leathery slightly glossy foliage.
The wood is pale brown or yellowish, undifferentiated and not prone to cracking.
The hard, round, knobbly, greenish yellow capsule which forms in February to July splits to expose shiny black seeds, enclosed in an oily, sticky, bright orange-red coat.
Plant Type: Shrub.
Seeds desiccated at 26°C with silica gel to 4-6% mc had germination values of over 80%.
Fruits are borne from March to July in West Africa and from November to June in Southern Africa.
Individual flowers do not hang down but are oriented horizontally.
Long.fruits, reminiscent of sausages, grow on this tree.
Sausage tree inflorescence.
The bark is grey and smooth at first, peeling on older trees.
This strange, semi-deciduous tree bears beautiful, bell-like, purple-red flowers before producing its sausage-shaped fruits, from which its common name derives.
Inflorescence a pendulous, lax, terminal panicle 30-100 cm long.
Vector Notes Long Distance Local References Germplasm Often cultivated in botanical gardens.
Bimodal Summer Uniform Winter.
According to author/nature photographer Winston Williams, these stems, or peduncles can be up to 7.5 m in length.
The huge, grey-brown fruits, 800 x 120 mm.
Broadleaved Perennial Seed / spore propagated Tree Vegetatively propagated Woody.
Flowers are produced in panicles , they are bell-shaped , orange to maroon or purplish green, and about 10 cm wide.
Developing flower.
The tiny, bell-shaped flowers which bloom from August to January , are yellow-green, with male and female flowers on separate trees.
It can be as thick as 6 mm on a 15-centimetre diameter branch.
The leaves are opposite or in whorls of three, 30 to 51 cm long, pinnate , with six to ten oval leaflets up to 20 cm long and 5.7 cm in diameter,the terminal leaflet can be either present or absent.
The fruits are unique, huge, grey-brown and sausage like and weigh about 4- 10 kg.
In Kruger National Park, South Africa, the minimum size of trees producing fruits was 16.7 cm diameter at breast height.
Cydonia oblonga.
It is a tree growing up to 20 m tall and it typically has spreading branches.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

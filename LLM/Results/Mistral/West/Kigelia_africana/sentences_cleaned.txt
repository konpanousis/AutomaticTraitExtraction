This strange, semi-deciduous tree bears beautiful, bell-like, purple-red flowers.
The fruit pulp is fibrous, containing many seeds.
Leaves opposite or in whorls of 3, imparipinnate, crowded towards the tips of the branches, leaflets 5-11, opposite, sessile or subsessile except the terminal one with petiolule 1-4 cm long, leaflet lamina 3.5-20 x 2.5-11 cm, ovate-elliptic, apex obtuse, broadly tapering to rounded or retuse, base rounded to cuneate, slightly to strongly asymmetric except in the terminal leaflet which is symmetric, glabrous to more or less hairy on both surfaces, margins entire, serrate or toothed and sometimes conspicuously wavy, lateral nerves impressed above and prominent below, petiole 3.5-15 cm long, rhachis sulcate above, terete below.

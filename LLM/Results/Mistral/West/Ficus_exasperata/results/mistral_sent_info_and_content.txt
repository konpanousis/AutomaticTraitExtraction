We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Ficus exasperata.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Flowers or fruits not seen.
Habit is densely branched erect shrub and not a slender diffuse trailing shrub.
Stem without aerial roots, sometimes buttressed in very large specimens, bark grey to whitish, smooth, with a watery, sometimes amber-coloured sap.
Figs in pairs or solitary in the leaf-axils, just below the leaves or sometimes on the olderwood, peduncle 0.5-1 cm.
The leaves, when plucked, exude a clear, viscid sap unlike the milky white latex of some other Ficus spp.
The fruits measure 3cm across and mature ripe ones are red.
Ficus exasperata is distinguished by its leaf blade being more uniformly symmetrical and having 3-4 pairs of prominent, up-curving lateral veins, whereas that of Ficus asperifolia tends to be asymmetric and to have 6-8 less prominent lateral veins.
In F. heterophylla the stipules are 2 to each leaf, ovate, scarious and about half an inch long.
Ficus exasperata trees are either female, with inflorescences bearing long-styled female flowers, or hermaphrodite, with inflorescences bearing male and short-styled female flowers.
Shrub or tree up to 20 m tall, terrestrial.
A deciduous tree, up to 70 ft. high.
It is often a branched erect shrub.
Shrub or tree up to 20 m. tall.
Flowers unisexual, male flowers with 3-6-lobed perianth and 1-3 stamens, female flowers with 4-6 tepals, seed flowers and gall flowers distinct.
Coppice shoots with lobed leaves Provided by:.
Ficus exasperata , also called the sandpaper tree , forest sandpaper fig , white fig , or sandpaper leaf tree , is a deciduous, and dioecious species of plant in the mulberry family Moraceae , native to tropical Africa and southern Asia.
Leafy twigs 1 -5 mm.
Exudates Latex watery, profuse.
The tree was almost 8 metre tall and the leaves measured 12×3 cm.
The leaves are lobed when young.
All figs present a white to yellowish latex , some in copious quantities, the twig shows paired stipules -or circular scars if the stipules have fallen off, the lateral veins at the base of the leaf are steep, forming a tighter angle with the midrib than the other lateral veins, a feature referred to as "triveined".
The tree is full of yellow fruits, and almost no leaves.
The leaves of a young Ficus exasperata are strikingly similar before transforming into their usually recognizable and mature shape.
Shrub or tree, up to 20 m. tall.
In F. exasperata the stipules are minute.
Small to medium-sized tree.
Inflorescence / Flower Inflorescence syconia, axillary, solitary, scabrid, flowers unisexual, peduncle to 1.5 cm.
Sap viscid, not milky.
Leaves almost distichous and alternate, sometimes subopposite, lamina ovate to elliptic or obovate, sometimes to oblong or subcircular, 2-16 x 1-12 cm.
Nearly half of fig species are gynodioecious, and therefore have some plants with inflorescences with long styled pistillate flowers, and other plants with staminate flowers mixed with short styled pistillate flowers.
Characteristic feature: leaves are rough like a sand-paper.
The many small flowers are unseen unless the fig is cut open.
Flavonoids Tannins Xanthones Parts Used Bark, Root, Leaves.
Figs in pairs or solitary in the leaf axils, just below the leaves or sometimes on the older wood, peduncle 5-10 mm.
Fig plants can be monoecious or gynodioecious.

Leaves alternate, stiff and leathery, ovate-elliptic, up to 14 x 7.5 cm, larger and broader in deeply shaded specimens, 3-veined from the base, mid-green above, paler and with conspicuous yellow veining below, very rough to the touch on both surfaces, margin finely and irregularly toothed to entire.
This tree appeared leafless but was full of the yellow fruits.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Habit is densely branched erect shrub and not a slender diffuse trailing shrub.
Stem without aerial roots, sometimes buttressed in very large specimens, bark grey to whitish, smooth, with a watery, sometimes amber-coloured sap.
Figs in pairs or solitary in the leaf-axils, just below the leaves or sometimes on the olderwood, peduncle 0.5-1 cm.
The leaves, when plucked, exude a clear, viscid sap unlike the milky white latex of some other Ficus spp.
The fruits measure 3cm across and mature ripe ones are red.
Ficus exasperata is distinguished by its leaf blade being more uniformly symmetrical and having 3-4 pairs of prominent, up-curving lateral veins, whereas that of Ficus asperifolia tends to be asymmetric and to have 6-8 less prominent lateral veins.
In F. heterophylla the stipules are 2 to each leaf, ovate, scarious and about half an inch long.
Ficus exasperata trees are either female, with inflorescences bearing long-styled female flowers, or hermaphrodite, with inflorescences bearing male and short-styled female flowers.

Ficus exasperata , also called the sandpaper tree , forest sandpaper fig , white fig , or sandpaper leaf tree , is a deciduous, and dioecious species of plant in the mulberry family Moraceae , native to tropical Africa and southern Asia.
Leafy twigs 1 -5 mm.
Exudates Latex watery, profuse.
The tree was almost 8 metre tall and the leaves measured 12×3 cm.
The leaves are lobed when young.
All figs present a white to yellowish latex , some in copious quantities, the twig shows paired stipules -or circular scars if the stipules have fallen off, the lateral veins at the base of the leaf are steep, forming a tighter angle with the midrib than the other lateral veins, a feature referred to as "triveined".
The tree is full of yellow fruits, and almost no leaves.
The leaves of a young Ficus exasperata are strikingly similar before transforming into their usually recognizable and mature shape.
Shrub or tree, up to 20 m. tall.
In F. exasperata the stipules are minute.

Inflorescence / Flower Inflorescence syconia, axillary, solitary, scabrid, flowers unisexual, peduncle to 1.5 cm.
Sap viscid, not milky.
Leaves almost distichous and alternate, sometimes subopposite, lamina ovate to elliptic or obovate, sometimes to oblong or subcircular, 2-16 x 1-12 cm.
Nearly half of fig species are gynodioecious, and therefore have some plants with inflorescences with long styled pistillate flowers, and other plants with staminate flowers mixed with short styled pistillate flowers.
Characteristic feature: leaves are rough like a sand-paper.
The many small flowers are unseen unless the fig is cut open.

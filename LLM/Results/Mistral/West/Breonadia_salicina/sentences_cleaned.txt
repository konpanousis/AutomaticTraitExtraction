Grey fissured and scaly bark.
The single-trunked Matumi has a moderate density and an irregular, narrow canopy of shiny green leaves.
The head of flowers is on a slender stalk, 20-95 mm long, and has 2 leaf-like bracts below the head of flowers.
Leaves in whorls of 3 to 5 near the ends of branches, lanceolate to narrowly elliptic, leathery, dark green with the midrib yellow, raised conspicuously.
Seeds 2.2-2.8 mm long, narrowly compressed, obovoid.
Growth rings: 2: growth ring boundaries indistinct or absent.
Seeds obovoid, narrowly compressed, 2-3 mm long.
When the tree is mature the base becomes thick, with grey to grey-brown, longitudinal, rough bark ridges throughout the trunk.
Fruit is a ball of small, brown, 2-lobed capsules, 2-3 mm long, densely packed into rounded heads and having a rough, bristly appearance, in winter, June to July.
Pollen presenter green, 0.5 mm long, ellipsoid or capitate.
The leaves occur alternately or in whorls of 3 to 5.
The leathery leaves are thin with a smooth margin and tend to grow upwards, like the leaves of a pineapple.
Anatomy     Wood-anatomical description : Growth rings: 2: growth ring boundaries indistinct or absent.
The small flowers are inconspicuous and sweetly scented, making way for pale yellow spheres which carry the fruit of the tree from November to March.
The flowers occur in 15-25 mm diameter, spherical, compact heads, made up of numerous, minute, pale mauve flowers.
Medium to large tree 3-21 m. tall, bark grey, fissured and scaly, branches glabrous.
The bark of the Matumi is grey brown and rough and sometimes has light green lichen patches which are very attractive.
Properties     The heartwood may vary from yellowish to pale brown, pinkish brown, dark brown, dark grey or reddish, with brown or black markings, it is indistinctly or distinctly demarcated from the 2.5-5 cm wide sapwood.

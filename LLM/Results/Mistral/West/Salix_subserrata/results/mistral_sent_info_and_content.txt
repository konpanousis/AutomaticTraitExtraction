We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Salix subserrata.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:

Woody stems dark red-brown or black, shallowly longitudinally furrowed, glabrous or more rarely with short fine light brown ± erect hairs and few inconspicuous small pale lenticels, young stems lighter, often densely short-hairy.
Morphology A riverside bush or small tree, 8-30 ft. high.
Leaf-blades narrowly elliptical, on juvenile growth markedly larger, 11-15 cm.
The leaf midribs in picture are whitish.
The short stalks bear the leaves horizontally.

Deciduous shrub or small tree.
The upper stems in the photo are reddish, which is common for these trees.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

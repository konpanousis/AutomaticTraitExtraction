Cadaba , aerial part, fresh.
Cadaba farinosa is a perennial shrub species with yellowish-grey bark.
Fruits subtorulose, 11/2-21/2 in.
The inner sepals are almost flat and have a stump tip.
Each sits on a 5-15 mm long flower stalk , has four, somewhat unequal, elliptical sepals that fall after flowering.

Each sits on a 5–15 mm long flower stalk, has four, somewhat unequal, elliptical sepals that fall after flowering.
The flowers may be clustered in small apical, flat-topped grapes, or solitary.
The ovary, that contains one cavity, sits on a stalk on top of the androgynophore and has a cylinder shape.
.The inner sepals are almost flat and have a stump tip.
Cadaba farinosa is an evergreen tangled shrub, growing to a height of 5-8 m. Cadaba has many arching branches covered with smooth brown-reddish bark.
The fruits of Cadaba farinosa are oblong, densely farinose, and orange-red centred.
Young twigs bear hairs or sessile scales.
When young, the leaves appear powdery, but they become gradually hairless.
The outer sepals are 5–14 mm long, concave particularly near the tip, that appears pointed because the margins are folded against each other.
Outer sepals 5-14 mm long, oblong-ovate, concave, acute, covered with scales, inner sepals flattish, less acute.
At the base of the androgynophore, there is at a right angle an upwardly directed tube-shaped appendage of 6-7 mm long, colored like the petals.
Description  Cadaba is an evergreen shrub found in Africa that is mostly used as a browse for livestock.
It has simple ovate leaves with entire margins, zygomorphic, spidery, greenish, yellowish, whitish or pinkish flowers, and is covered in powdery hairs or scales, particularly the younger parts.
The ovary , that contains one cavity, sits on a stalk on top of the androgynophore and has a cylinder shape.
.The simple and entire leaves are alternate set along the branches, and have narrow, persistent stipules of up to 1½
Cadaba farinosa'' is a 2–8 m high evergreen shrub or small tree that belongs to the caper family.
Individual seeds are 2½-3 mm , rounded to kidney-shaped, and are embedded in an orange-red pulp.
General Information Shrubs, much branched with slender to twiggy tangled branches, up to 5 m high, young twigs farinose with small white waxy sessile scales, becoming glabrous with age.
It grows up to 5 M. It is perennial.
Gynophore usually densely covered with stalked scales.
Inflorescence a rather dense but few-flowered shortly subcorymbose raceme, pedicels 5-15 mm.
The four petals, which fall earlier than the sepals, are approximately 12 mm long, and consist of a linear, up-curved claw of 6–7 mm long, that gradually passes into a wider, creamy, yellowish or dirty pink colored, oblanceolate 4–5 mm long blade.
Morphology A hoary shrub, branched from the base, erect or scrambling amongst other shrubs and trees Provided by:.
Four to five stamens attach halfway up the gynophore.
Fruit narrowly cylindrical, 20-50 mm long, 3-4 mm broad, obscurely torulose, farinaceous, many seeded, seeds c.2.5 mm in diam., surrounded by orange flesh.
On young shoots, it has alternate leaves, while on older wood, leaves are in clusters.
These flowers consist of four sepals, none or four petals with a narrow claw at base and a wider plate at the top, a tube-shaped nectar producing appendix, four or five stamens that are merged for about half their length into a so-called androgynophore , and a gynophore on top of which will develop a cylindrical capsule with one or two cavities that contain many small kindney-shaped seeds, and opens with two valves.
These have simple, alternately set leaves.
The bilaterally symmetric flowers are arranged individually or with a few together in small inflorescences at the tip of the side branches.
Fruits narrowly cylindrical, up to 40 mm.
Leaf-blade is oblong or ellipitic in shape, rounded at the extremities, very variable in size , greyish in colour.
Leaf-blade elliptic to roundly elliptic, sometimes obovate or obovate-oblong, 5-50 mm.
Cadaba fruits are orange in colour, cylindrical, dehiscent capsules, 4 cm long x 4 mm in diameter, slightly constricted around the numerous seeds.
Slender much branched and rather densely twiggy and tangled shrub with arching branches, up to 5 m. tall, or more rarely a tree to 8 m. Provided by:.
Seeds surrounded by a red or orange membrane or flesh.
Cadaba farinosa is a usually much branched shrub, mostly 2-3 m high, but under favorable circumstances a shrub of 5 m or a tree up to 8 m.
Petals 10-14 mm long, 3-4 mm broad , limb narrowly elliptic-lanceolate.
The flowers have both stamens and a pistel.
.After ferilisation, this develops into a powdery cylindrical capsule of 2–4 cm long and about 3 mm in diameter, with many seeds and slight constricted between these, which open with two valves from the base when ripe.

The zygomorphic flowers, are solitary or stand in small clusters at the end of short side branches.
The base of the five stamens and the pistol have merged into a horizontally oriented 4-5 mm long androgynophore , with the free upper parts of the filaments 1-2 cm long and carrying 3½ mm long, very quickly falling anthers.
The simple and entire leaves are alternate set along the branches, and have narrow, persistent stipules of up to 1½ mm long, at both sides of an up to 3 mm long leaf stalk , which carries an oblong or elliptical leaf blade of 5-50 mm long and 3-30 mm wide, rounded or pointed with a short stiff tip.

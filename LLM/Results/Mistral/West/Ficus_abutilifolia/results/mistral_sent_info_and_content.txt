We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Ficus abutilifolia.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
It is named for the similarity of its broadly ovate leaves to that of Abutilon.
Crown spreading, more or less dense.
Ficus abutilifolia is a hardy, deciduous, small to medium sized fig tree that has beautiful, large, heart-shaped leaves.

It is a lithophytic plant that grows on rocky outcrops, reaching 10 m in height.
Ficus platypoda grows as a lithophytic shrub or tree to 10 m high.
Roots: Conspicuous, white to yellow, often exposed extending sinuously over the rock surface and into crevices, well adapted to hugging rock faces and splitting rocks and earning this species a place among the true rock-splitting figs.
It is virtually restricted to cliff faces and rock outcrops, and is easily recognized from its large, glabrous leaves and smooth, pale bark.
These veins are red-brown in young leaves and yellow in older leaves.
Stems: Main stem crooked, twisted or contorted branching low down, exuding a milky latex when cut.
Bark creamy-white or yellowish-white, rather smooth, powdery or somewhat flaking.
They may be sessile or on short, stout stalks up to 15 mm long and are green becoming yellow or red when ripe.
Size 2 to 10m.
The leaves are alternately arranged along the stems and are elliptical to oval in shape, measuring 5.3 to 16.7 cm long by 3.1 to 13.3 cm wide.
The gnarled, yellow white, smooth trunk is often twisted and has smooth, papery bark that peels off.

Definitie: An autotroph which is capable of transforming light into chemical energy.

Description: Ficus abutilifolia is a bushy shrub 3-4 m tall, eventually becoming a small tree tree 10-15 m tall, deciduous or semi-deciduous with white stems and roots that stand out against the rocks.
The leaves are broadly ovate and heart-shaped to almost round and are cordate at the base, ranging in size from 75-200 x 65-180 mm.

Ficus abutilifolia is a small to medium-sized, deciduous to semi-deciduous tree up to 15 m high, though it seldom exceeds 5 m.
The showy -Klipvy- is a small to medium-size, deciduous to semi-deciduous tree that can grow up to a height of 15m, but seldom exceeds 5m.
Large figs grow directly from the trunk, with a mottled green white appearance.
The trunk is usually twisted or contorted, the branchlets stout and glabrous and marked with leaf and stipular scars.
Principal lateral veins 5-7 on either side of midrib, conspicuous, basal ones prominent, yellowish ending at the margin at or above the middle of the lamina, tertiary venation partly scalariform.
The bark is whitish to yellowish white and smooth, powdery or somewhat flaking, and it is this conspicuous bark that is immediately apparent.
They are borne in the axils of the leaves from September to March.
Fig arrangement.
Leaves: Altemate in spirals with petiole 2-18 cm long, 2-4 mm thick, lamina leathery, to cordiform, broadly ovate, almost circular or subreniform, 5-20 cm long, 5-18 cm broad, smooth or slightly hairy, particularly on veins, margins entire slightly wavy, apex rounded to acute, base heart-shaped.
Foliage of a southern specimen.
The oval to round figs pale can be various shades of yellow, orange, pink, red or purple and 0.9-2.8 cm long by 1-2.8 cm across.
It is a smalish tree with a smooth bark that has a white colour.
It is one of the rock splitter figs and has white stems and roots that flatten themselves out along rocks.

The leaves are large and heart shaped with prominent veins.
Perennials and small shrubs.
Trees and large shrubs.
Leafy twigs 6–15 mm thick, stout, hairless or almost so and marked with leaf and stipular scars.
The branchlets are covered in fine hairs.
The fruit, which are 15-25 mm in diameter, are borne singly or in pairs in the leaf axils on terminal branchlets, and are smooth to slightly hairy.
Fruit : Borne singly or in pairs in the leaf axils on terminal branchlets or on bare branches below the leaves, basal bracts 2.5–3.5 mm.
They are glabrous on both surfaces, occasionally with velvety hairs beneath, with 4-9 pairs of secondary veins, entire wavy margins and a petiole up to 120 mm long.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

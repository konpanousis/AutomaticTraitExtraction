We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Leucaena leucocephala.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Bimodal Summer Uniform Winter.
The younger stems are green and usually densely covered in fine greyish coloured hairs.
It has a deep taproot and is highly branched.
The leaves are twice-compound and have 3-10 pairs of branchlets.
The leaves are twice-pinnately compound, to about a foot long, with four to nine pairs of pinnae , and usually a dimple-like gland on the rachis between the lowermost pair.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

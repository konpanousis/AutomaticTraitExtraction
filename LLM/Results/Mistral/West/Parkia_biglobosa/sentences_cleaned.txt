The head is divided into two sections, a cylinder about 2 cm long and a globular head about 6 cm diameter.
Up to 40 pairs of pinnae have up to 65 pairs of leaflets each.
Forming a fringe at the top of the cylinder are the staminodial flowers, these are followed by the nectar producing flowers, both types are about 7 mm long, stamens in the latter do not appear to be fertile, but the base of the staminal filaments are nectariferous, producing copious nectar late in the afternoon and evening, a strong fruity odour is present.

African locust bean grows up to 20 m tall or even taller on fertile soils and has a large, spreading, umbrella-shaped crown.
Flowers red, tree.
Microsatellite primers for Parkia biglobosa reveal that a single plant sires all seeds per pod.
The bisexual flowers are tightly packed together to form the globular head.
They are 30-40 centimetres long on average, with some reaching lengths of about 45 centimetres.
The diameter zones ranges from 8mm to 26mm with wider zones recorded against Serratia marscesens , Salmonella Subsp.
There are two types of seed within each pod - reddish-dark and dark.

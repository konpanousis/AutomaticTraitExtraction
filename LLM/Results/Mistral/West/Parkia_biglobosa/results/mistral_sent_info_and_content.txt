We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Parkia biglobosa.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
African locust bean is a multipurpose tree.
Bisexual flowers are pentamerous, 1-1.4 cm long, and corolla lobes are fused at their base.
Medium to large sized, deciduous tree to 60-90 ft / 20-30 m. Drought tolerant, minimal frost tolerance.
Leaflets held on a long rachis.
These flowers are about 17 mm long with the red stamens extending about 4 mm beyond the corolla lobes.
The seed consists of 30% testa and 70% cotyledon.
The many flowers are either bisexual, sterile or nectar-bearing.
Size and number of pinnae and ultimate leaflets varies, on this tree the leaflets are about 12 mm long and 8 mm wide.
Leaves alternate, dark green, bipinnate to 30 cm long, pinnae up to 17 pairs with 13-60 pairs of leaflets, 8-30 mm x 1.5-8 mm, of distinctive shape and venation.
The fruit is a linear, glabrous and smooth, indehiscent pod that becomes brown at maturity.
It is a deciduous perennial that grows to between 7 and 20 metres high, in some cases up to 30 metres.
Descri ption.Parkia biglobosa is a perennial deciduous tree with a height ranging from 7 to 20 m, although it can reach 30 m under exceptional conditions.
The seeds are hardcoated and can remain viable up to 8 years.
African locust bean is a long lived perennial that starts flowering 5-7 years after planting.
Oliphant CM, Green GM.
The head is divided into two sections, a cylinder about 2 cm long and a globular head about 6 cm diameter.
Up to 40 pairs of pinnae have up to 65 pairs of leaflets each.
Forming a fringe at the top of the cylinder are the staminodial flowers, these are followed by the nectar producing flowers, both types are about 7 mm long, stamens in the latter do not appear to be fertile, but the base of the staminal filaments are nectariferous, producing copious nectar late in the afternoon and evening, a strong fruity odour is present.
Product Description.5 seeds per pack.
Capitula are red, turning to salmon pink, biglobose, 45-70 x 33-60 mm, with hermaphrodite and staminoidal flowers, on peduncles up to 30 cm long.
The seeds are globose-ovoid, 5-15 mm, smooth and glossy dark in colour.
Pollen is in the form of polyads as in wattles.
The fruit split open when mature and contain about 20 flattened black seeds, embedded in a yellow fruit pulp containing sucrose.
It is 12-30  cm long x 1.5-2.5 cm wide and contains up to 23 seeds embedded in a yellowish mealy pulp.
Trees reach their maximum height after 30-50 years, and can reach the age of 100.
The tree reaches its maximum height between 30 and 50 years and may live up to 100 years.
The flowerhead is 4.5-7 cm long x 3.5-6 cm broad and it has a strong pungent smell.
The ball-like remnant flower-heads produce clusters of pods, which grow into fruits that are brown pods, slightly bent, about 45 cm long and 2 cm wide, hanging in racemes from the club-shaped fruit base.
Flower colour, life form.
The leaves are dark green, bipinnate, up to 40 cm long with an orbicular gland on the petiole.
The pods of the tree, commonly referred to as locust beans, are pink in the beginning and turn dark brown when fully mature.
The flowers begin to open at dusk, close and wilt at dawn, lasting only a single night.
The flowers are borne in pendent capitula or heads at the end of a thick peduncle up to 25 cm long.
Its beanets are numerous , subopposite, 8-30 mm long x 1.5-10 mm wide, rounded or obtuse at apex, glabrous but slightly ciliate near apex.
Broadleaved Perennial Seed propagated Tree Woody.
Leaflets are oblong to linear, 0.8-3.0 cm x 0.2-0.8 cm.
Tropical Fruit Ci-E.
Tropical Fruit A-Ch.
The rachis is greyish to light brown and pubescent.
Flowers on each mature capitulum open late in the afternoon, first the flowers in the staminodial fringe then the others.
The seeds, 5-20 per pod, are oval and weigh about 250 mg each.
The leaves are alternate and bipinnately compound, 30-40 cm long, bearing up to 17 pairs of pinnae.
This leguminous tree from central Africa has alternate leaves, bipinnate and up to 36 cm long.
The first true leaf is a cataphyll, and subsequent juvenile leaves are bipinnate usually with 3 pairs of pinnae.
Crown large, spreads wide with branches low down on a stout bole, amber gum exudes from wounds, bark dark grey brown, thick, fissured.
Tropical Fruit S-Z.
African locust bean is a medium-sized legume tree that reaches 20-30 m high.
The tree is a fire-resistant heliophyte characterized by a thick dark gray-brown bark.
Sterile flowers are shorter and are borne near the peduncle, in the upper part of the inflorescence, and their nectar is attractive to bats that pollinate the flowers.
African locust bean grows up to 20 m tall or even taller on fertile soils and has a large, spreading, umbrella-shaped crown.
Flowers red, tree.
Microsatellite primers for Parkia biglobosa reveal that a single plant sires all seeds per pod.
The bisexual flowers are tightly packed together to form the globular head.
They are 30-40 centimetres long on average, with some reaching lengths of about 45 centimetres.
The diameter zones ranges from 8mm to 26mm with wider zones recorded against Serratia marscesens , Salmonella Subsp.
There are two types of seed within each pod - reddish-dark and dark.
The bark is longitudinally fissured, scaly between the fissures, thick, ash-grey to greyish-brown in colour.
The inflorescence is held on a long  drooping peduncle.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

The syconia , borne most often between June and October, are crowded towards the ends of the branchlets in the leaf axils or below the leaves.
B-phase fig.ostiole.
The latter is distinguished in having 7 to 11 pairs of lateral veins in the leaves as opposed to the 6 to 8 evident in F. lutea , and stalked fruit, the fruit of F. lutea being sessile.
Large, pinkish brown leaf stipules grow at the petiole base, notable on young leaves, but sometimes dropping off early.
Figs are 8 to 15mm diameter, hairy and red when ripe, singly or paired in leaf axils , clustered toward branch ends.
Bark greyish to pale brown, often peeling in big flakes, slash pale brown to reddish, latex milky white.
Calyptra present, shed very early.
The cream-coloured midrib and lateral veins are prominent upon the lower surface.
Bark is cream coloured, flaking, with the branchlets densely covered with yellow brown hairs.
Ficus glumosa variation intermedia Mart.
Ficus glumosa subspecies intermedia Mart.
Fruits singly or in pairs in the leaf axils pedunculate, spherical to ellipsoid, 8-15 mm in diameter, variously hairy, covered in small small warts, pink to red when ripe.
B-phase fig.split open shortly after pollination.
Leaf dimensions are 5 cm to 15 cm by 1,8 cm to 9 cm.
All figs present a white to yellowish latex , some in copious quantities, the twig shows paired stipules -or circular scars if the stipules have fallen off, the lateral veins at the base of the leaf are steep, forming a tighter angle with the midrib than the other lateral veins, a feature referred to as "triveined".
Leaves arranged spirally, simple and entire, stipules up to 1.5 cm long, falling off early, petiole up to 8 cm long, blade oblong, broadly elliptical, broadly ovate, obovate or almost circular, 2-19 cm x 1-13 cm, base cordate or rounded, apex acuminate to subobtuse, glabrous to densely hairy above, densely hairy below, lateral veins in 3-7 pairs, tertiary venation reticulate.
The older leaves fall to the ground and are responsible for leaving large scars behind.
The younger parts of the tree, such as the young leaves, branches and petioles, are covered with golden to greyish hairs, or it may show almost a lack of hairs.

Its large, spreading crown can span 30 to 45 m in width.
Leaves are simple, oval-shaped to oblong, 50-150 x 20-90 mm, dark green and smooth on the upper surface and lighter green on the lower surface.
Although exhibiting many distinctive characters, Ficus lutea can superficially resemble F. trichopoda with which there is some distribution overlap.
Trees up to 10 m. tall or shrubs, terrestrial, branches spreading.
The bark is pale grey to yellowish grey and has a smooth to slightly rough texture, it often tends to flake off, but creates a nice decorative look.
Upper leaf surfaces are hairless when mature and dark green to greyish green, the lower surfaces are paler and yellower green, finely hairy, sometimes with scattered longish hairs as well.
Leaves alternate, stipules free, lateral, pubescent, up to 3 cm long, petiole up to 4 cm long, glabrous to pubescent or lanate, blade papery, broadly ovate to elliptic or oblong, 3-10 x 2-5 cm, base cordate, margin entire, apex rounded, mucronate, acute or acuminate, smooth and glabrous above, glabrescent to densely pubescent or lanate beneath, with 5-7 pairs of lateral veins.
Some net-veining is also visible but not raised.
Nearly half of fig species are gynodioecious, and therefore have some plants with inflorescences with long styled pistillate flowers, and other plants with staminate flowers mixed with short styled pistillate flowers.
Bark pale greyish-cream, smooth and flaking.
Description     Shrub or small tree up to 10 m tall, outer bark flaking, inner bark exuding sticky white latex, leafy twigs glabrous or white hairy.
The many small flowers are unseen unless the fig is cut open.
Inflorescence a fig, consisting of an urn-shaped receptacle with a narrow apical opening, the flowers enclosed within, figs solitary or in pairs in the leaf axils or just below, almost sessile, globose to ellipsoid, 1-1.5 cm in diameter, glabrous to densely tomentose, orange to red, at the fruiting stage often with darker spots.
Flowers unisexual, with 2-4 tepals, male flowers with one stamen, female flowers with 1-celled ovary and short or long style.
Usually a small tree, most commonly as a lithophytic rock-splitter.
Fig plants can be monoecious or gynodioecious.
The leaf tip is rounded to tapering, the base rounded to shallowly lobed or heart-shaped, the margins entire.
Four to seven lateral veins ascend on either side of the midrib towards the margins, without quite reaching them, but joining each other along variable routes.

Ficus superba variation henneana Corner.
Ficus glumosa Delile.
The lovely smooth, glossy leaves are very large in size, as the common name would suggest, and are quite distinctive, ranging from 130 to 430 mm in length and up to 200 mm in width.
Ficus glumosa.
Branches may be finely hairy when young, becoming smooth with age.
The lowest pair of veins start from the leaf base.
Leaves are alternate, broadly elliptical 30 - 140 x 15 - 95mm in size, 3-veined from the base, veins are raised on the underside of the leaf.

Clustered, sessile fruits are produced in the leaf axils towards the end of the branches from early spring until late summer.
The white stipule contains a new leaf and a new stipule.
Ficus glumosa can easily grow up to 15 m high, the crown is roundish and may be open or closed, the branches of the tree tends to grow quite low.

Ficus glumosa leaves.
Ficus glumosa also known as the Mountain or Hairy Rock Fig is an Afrotropical fig shrub or tree, growing up to 20 m tall.
The fruit typically has a bulbous shape with a small opening at the outward end that allows access to pollinators.

Ficus ilicina Miq. is a shrub or small tree up to 5 m tall, sometimes lianescent, with smooth but flaky bark, roots often plastered over rocks, elliptical, oblong or oblanceolate leaves 3-9 cm x 3-5 cm and globose figs, c. 1 cm in diameter, solitary or in pairs.
Leaves oblong to broadly elliptic, more rarely ovate or almost round, 4-14 cm, dark green above, paler below, thickly leathery, with long silky hairs on both surfaces, particularly on the veins.
Perennials and small shrubs.
Prospects     Ficus glumosa is a multipurpose tree or shrub, particularly valuable in drier areas for its edible young leaves and ripe fruits.
They are held towards the ends of the branches, are ovate to elliptic or obovate, and exhibit clear yellow veining.
Trees and large shrubs.
The spirally arranged or alternate leaves of Ficus glumosa grow on fairly short, usually hairy petioles.
The genus Dorstenia , also in the fig family , exhibits similar tiny flowers arranged on a receptacle but in this case the receptacle is a more or less flat, open surface.
It is a shrub or small tree up to 10 m tall, outer bark flaking, inner bark exuding sticky white latex, leafy twigs glabrous or white hairy.
Hairs sometimes almost lost on older leaves, base cordate or rounded, veins prominent below, margin entire.

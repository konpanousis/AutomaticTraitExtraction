We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Boscia angustifolia.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Small evergreen tree up to 10 m. tall with a spreading rounded crown and smooth grey or silvery bark.
These leaves are narrow  lanceolate or linear in shape and pale green in colour.
Boscia integrifolia Brunner Boscia intermedia Hochst.
Fruit round, c. 10 mm in diameter, yellow to blackish when ripe.
It has leaves with simple, alternate arrangement, leaf-blade is lanceolate to oblong outline with a coriaceous and glabrous upper surface, short, fine hairs beneath, it is 1.5-5 cm long and 1-1.5 cm wide, petiole is 2-7 mm long.
In the wild, the crown of  boscia is cylindrical, but this shape is seldom found since the shrub is frequently lopped for feeding livestock and thus the crown is mostly round-shaped.
Fruit: round berry, 6-8 mm diam., yellow to black, hairless.
The leaf blade is 2-4.5 cm long x 0.7-2 cm broad, with conspicuous midrib and reticulum on both faces.
Leaves mostly clustered on very small woody spurs along the branches, oblanceolate to elliptic, 2-7 cm, leathery, dark green above and finely hairy only when young, hairless later, paler grey-green and densely hairy below, midrib grooved along the top, apex broadly tapering to rounded, often with a sharp point.
Flowers are greenish to white, terminal or axillary clustered in raceme type of inflorescence.
Fruit is spherical berries, about 6-10 mm in diameter.
Leaves alternate, clearly spaced on shoots of the current year, in fascicles of 2 or more on the older wood, petiolate, blade oblanceolate, oblanceolate-elliptic to obovate, 2-5 cm.
Fruits spheroid or slightly ellipsoid, 10-12 mm.
Flowers: terminal raceme, flowers small, greenish-yellow, flowering sporadically throughout the year.
Boscia , aerial part, fresh.
The flowers are small greenish-white, clustered in short terminal corymbose racemes, 3-6 cm long x 3-7 cm in diameter.
Twigs glabrous or initially densely pubescent, glabrescent.
Morphology Flowers greenish, fragrant.
Boscia angustifolia is a shrub or small tree with lanceolate leaves commonly found in the savannah zones of Africa, from Senegal moving eastwards to Sudan.
Boscia angustifolia.
The fruits need a year to ripen.They are edible, though bitter, spherical, rough-skinned berries, up to 13 mm in diameter, reddish grey in colour.
Flowers in dense branched terminal heads, small, without petals, creamy-white to yellowish, sweetly scented.
Large shrub or small tree, to 4 m.
Gynophore shorter than the filaments at anthesis, generally glabrous, ovary ovoid to ellipsoid, stigma flatly capitate, borne on a very short thick style.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

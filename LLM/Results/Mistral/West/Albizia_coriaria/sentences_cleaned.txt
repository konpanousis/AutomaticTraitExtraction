Albizia coriaria is a deciduous tree 6-36 m tall.
The flowers are subsessile or on pedicels 0.5-2 mm long, minute bracteoles, 1.5-2 mm long usually falling off before flowering.
The fruit is an oblong, flat pod, densely but finely pubescent, transversely veined, and pale brown when ripe.
Medium-size tree.
Leaves are alternate, bipinnately compound with 3 to 10 pairs of pinnae with ovate to lanceolate stipules and leaflets in 5 to 17 pairs per pinna.
It is heavily branched forming a spreading dome-shaped crown.
Calyx 3.5-6.5 mm.
Bark gray-black, rough and raggedly scaling.
Albizia adianthifolia has a flattened crown, with large, spreading branches, young branches densely yellowish or reddish pubescent.
Young branchlets rather hairy.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.
Tree crown spreading and flat, trunk often twisted.
The small flowers are in bundles, with stamens much longer than the petals.
Leaves bipinnate, pinnae 3-6 pairs, leaflets 6-11 pairs, oblong to elliptic 13-33 mm long, 5-17 mm wide, rounded at apex, subglabrous except for a few hairs on the midrib beneath.
Flowers subsessile or on pedicels 0.5-2 mm.
Tree 6-36 m. high, crown spreading, flat, bark rough, flaking off, young branchlets puberulous or shortly pubescent, later glabrescent.
Pod dehiscent, 14-21 x 3.2-3.7 cm., oblong, glabrous or nearly so, ± glossy, obscurely venose, brown or purplish-brown, usually ± tapered and acute at the base and sometimes at the apex.
Albizia adianthifolia is a medium to large deciduous tree growing up to 35 m in height.
It is usually unbuttressed, but can have small, thick buttresses up to 1.5 metres high.
The seeds are flattened, swollen, globose in shape and brown in colour.
Flowers subsessile or on pedicels 0.5-2 mm long, bracteoles minute, 1.5-2 mm long usually falling off before flowering.
Corolla 8-13.5 cm long, white and puberulous outside.
It usually grows up to 35m in height with a straight, cylindrical bole that can be branchless for up to 22m and a girth diameter of up to 100cm.
Seeds c. 9-12 x 8-9 mm., flattened.
The stamens are usually showy, although in some species such as A. canescens the flowers are inconspicuous.
Fruit a pod 10-21 cm long, 2-5 cm wide, glabrous or nearly so, brown or purplish-brown in colour with a tapered or acute apex.
Corolla white or whitish, 8-13.5 mm.
Calyx 3.5-6.5 mm long, not slit unilaterally, puberulous outside, with few shortly stipitate glands.

The bark is yellowish brown to grey, smooth or rough, inner bark granular, creamy to yellowish in colour with clear gum.
The fruit is a pod of about 10-21 cm long, 2-5 cm wide, glabrous, brown or purplish-brown in colour when matured with a tapered or acute apex.
The leaves are pinnately or bipinnately compound.
Leaves: rhachis ± thinly crisped-puberulous or shortly pubescent, pinnae 3-6 pairs, leaflets 6-11 pairs, 13-33 x 5-14 mm., oblong to elliptic- or ovate-oblong, rounded at the apex, subglabrous except for a few hairs on the midrib beneath, or sometimes ± thinly puberulous beneath especially towards the base.
The calyx are 3.5-6.5 mm long and not slit unilaterally, puberulous outside, with few short stipitate glands.
A seed sprouting up slowly.
The inflorescence is an axillary head with bisexual small flowers which are reddish to greenish white in colour.
A deciduous tree 6-36 m, the crown spreading and flat, the trunk often twisted, any buttresses short and blunt.
Morphology Staminal tube not or scarcely exserted beyond the corolla, filaments 1.7-4 cm.
The bole is up to 95 cm in diameter and is straight and cylindrical in closed forest but often crooked and/or twisted in more open savannah and bushland localities, usually without buttresses but with small, thick buttresses in forest localities.
The corolla are 8-13.5 cm long, white and puberulous outside.
Bipinnate with 3-6 pairs pinnae and 6-11 pairs of medium-large leaflets, all about equal in size, to 3 cm long, hardly one-sided, narrowly oval-oblong, rounded and often wider at the base, tip rounded.
The leaves are bipinnate, pinnae 3-6 pairs, and leaflets 6-11 pairs, oblong to elliptical and 13-33 mm long, 5-17 mm wide, rounded at the apex, subglabrous except for a few hairs on the midrib beneath.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Albizia coriaria.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

The calyx are 3.5-6.5 mm long and not slit unilaterally, puberulous outside, with few short stipitate glands.
A seed sprouting up slowly.
The inflorescence is an axillary head with bisexual small flowers which are reddish to greenish white in colour.
A deciduous tree 6-36 m, the crown spreading and flat, the trunk often twisted, any buttresses short and blunt.
Morphology Staminal tube not or scarcely exserted beyond the corolla, filaments 1.7-4 cm.
The bole is up to 95 cm in diameter and is straight and cylindrical in closed forest but often crooked and/or twisted in more open savannah and bushland localities, usually without buttresses but with small, thick buttresses in forest localities.
The corolla are 8-13.5 cm long, white and puberulous outside.
Bipinnate with 3-6 pairs pinnae and 6-11 pairs of medium-large leaflets, all about equal in size, to 3 cm long, hardly one-sided, narrowly oval-oblong, rounded and often wider at the base, tip rounded.
The leaves are bipinnate, pinnae 3-6 pairs, and leaflets 6-11 pairs, oblong to elliptical and 13-33 mm long, 5-17 mm wide, rounded at the apex, subglabrous except for a few hairs on the midrib beneath.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

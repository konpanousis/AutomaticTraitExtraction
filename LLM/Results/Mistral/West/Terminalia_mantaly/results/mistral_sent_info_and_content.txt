We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Terminalia mantaly.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Smooth, Glossy / Shiny, Thin.
The outer margin of the leaf is light golden yellow, accounting for about 1/2 of the leaf surface, and the center of the leaf is light green, so it is called silver edge olive kernel.

Fruit: Drupe plus ou moins charnue, fusiforme, aplatie, sans angle ni aile, ridée irrégulièrement à maturité, de 12 - 22 x 6 - 10 mm.

Self-compatible or apomictic.
Leaves small , mottled grey-green with irregular creamy-white border, young leaves pinkish-red, margins uneven to crenate, produced in whorls at branch tips.
If the crown is not balanced, after the winter leaves, slightly trim.
Every year, bright red leaves start to germinate in spring, and the leaves extend at the end of spring, with a length of 1 to 2 cm and a width of 1 cm.
Terminalia Mantaly Pruning Cut off the lower branches of the trunk, which can be very long.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

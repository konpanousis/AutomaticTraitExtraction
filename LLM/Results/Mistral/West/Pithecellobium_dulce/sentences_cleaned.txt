The bark on the branches and in younger trees is smooth, pale whitish-grey, lenticellate, often with horizontal ribs encircling the trunk and branches, becoming rougher and fissured on older boles.
Kamatsile is a tree 5 to 18 meters.
A few slender whip-like branches often straggle well beyond the rest of the crown.

Its trunk is spiny and up to nine meters in girth and its leaves are bipinnate.
The flowers are greenish-white, fragrant, sessile and reach about 12 cm in length, though appear shorter due to coiling.
Seeds are 6 to 8, with an edible, whitish,.
Seeds are dispersed by birds attracted by the red pods, and sweet fleshy white, pale-pink, or occasionally red arils which persist after the pods open.
P. dulce forms a small to medium-sized tree up to 15-20 m in height with a dbh of 30-50 cm, or even 100 cm.
Contents Pithecellobium dulce monkeypod Guam chil aka pithecellobium dulce Description As food As medicine Ecology Synonyms References Guam chil aka pithecellobium dulce Description Pithecellobium dulce is a tree that reaches a height of about 10 to 15 m.
It is usually multiple-stemmed, sometimes forming only a bush, but often forming a branchy tree with an irregular rounded crown and flexuous and pendulous branches.
The leaves are evenly 2-pinnate, 4 to 8 centimeters long.
The pods open along both sides to reveal 8-12 seeds which persist after the pods open, attached by the fleshy white, pale pink or occasionally red, aril.
The flowers produce a pod , which turns pink when ripe and opens to expose the seed arils, a pink or white, edible pulp.
The flowers are grouped in small, dense, sub-spherical heads, 7-12 mm in diameter, with 20-30 flowers per head, the heads arranged in fascicles of 2-4 in axils of leaves.
Its trunk is spiny and its leaves are bipinnate.
The leaves are abruptly bipinnate with a single pair of pinnae per leaf and two pairs of leaflets per pinna, i.e. 4 leaflets in all per leaf.
The unripe pods are fleshy, becoming dry and papery after opening.
There are 5 sepals and 5 petals fused into a tube, with 22-42 stamens per flower, also basally united into a staminal tube.
Pithecellobium dulce is a tree that reaches a height of about 10 to 15 m.
Seeds germinate within 1-2 days and germination of 20-70% can be expected.
The flowers are pale whitish-green and the stamen filaments are white.
Holm L, Pancho J V, Herberger J P, Plucknett D L, 1979.
The seeds are shiny black, compressed, lentiform, 7-13 x 6-11 x 2-4 mm in size.
Broadleaved Perennial Seed propagated Tree Woody.
Inga lanceolata sensu Blanco Inga lanceolata Willd.
The seed is dispersed via birds that feed on the sweet pulp.
The flowers. are white, in dense heads, 1 centimeter in diameter.
The pulp contains black shiny seeds that are circular and flat.
The leaflets are 25-56 mm long and 9-32 mm wide, obliquely elliptic or oblong elliptic with 4-7 pairs of pinnate veins, deep olive green above, paler grey-green below, with small glands, 0.3-0.8 mm high and 0.4-0.7 mm in diameter, at the tip of the petiole and the tip of the pinnular rachis.
The flowers produce a pod , which turns pink when ripe and opens to expose an edible pulp.
The shoots are randomly armed at nodes with pairs of straight, stout, stipular spines, 4-13 mm long, but are occasionally thornless.
Trees are generally evergreen or almost so, even in seasonally dry climates, as leaf fall and flush of new leaves often overlap.
The fruits are distinctive in shape and colour being spirally curved or coiled into 1-2 circles, noticeably constricted between the seeds, and green tinged red, turning bright rose or bright red as they ripen, and reddish-brown after dehiscence.
The arillus is sweet when the fruit is ripe.
Stewart JL, Dunsdon AJ, Hellin JJ, Hughes CE, 1992.
Pithecellobium differs consistently from all other genera of the tribe Ingeae by having a seed funicle modified into a spongy aril that cups the lower half of the seed, and by the presence of woody stipular spines.

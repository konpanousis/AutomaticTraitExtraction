Ficus trichopoda  may grow as either a medium-sized tree or a shrub.
So wide in fact that this is the only South African fig species to grow -banyan’ or stilt roots.
The bark of the main trunks and branches is smooth and grey in colour.
When the male flowers have finished producing pollen, the fig ripens and becomes attractive to fruit-eating animals which disperse the seeds.
Shrub or tree up to c. 10 m, terrestrial.
The veins are conspicuous, yellowish white above and red below.
The figs are slightly more flattened top and bottom than the common domestic fig, Ficus carica.
It becomes darker in older trees.
Figs up to four together in the leaf axils, peduncle 0.5â1.0 cm.
It is quite similar in appearance to the giant-leaved fig, F. lutea, but the latter has yellow figs, the veins and leaf stalks are yellow, and the apical bud has a silvery-coloured sheath.
Described as a large shrub or tree, garden specimens certainly grow into large, wide-spreading evergreen trees 12 to 25 metres tall.
The height is recorded as being between 12 and 25 m. It has a rounded, spreading crown and may spread further sideways by sending down aerial roots which become new stems.
Perennials and small shrubs.
Trees and large shrubs.
The sheaths enfolding the apical buds and the leaf stalks are also red.
The bark is mostly pale and smooth with some mottling.

They can attain a diameter of 20mm when mature and turn bright red when they are ripe.
Leaves are large, up to 230mm long and about half as wide, heart shaped and bright green with prominent veins.

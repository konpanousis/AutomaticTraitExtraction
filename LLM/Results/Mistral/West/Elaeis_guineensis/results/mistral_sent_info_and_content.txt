We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Elaeis guineensis.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Staminate and pistillate flowers are produced on different inflorescences , but on the same palm at different times and may be cream to white in color.
The leaves are pinnate , and reach between 3-5 m long.
Leaves to 7.5 m. long in well-grown adults, leaf-base long-persistent, with coarse brown fibres and upward pointing fibre-spines to 35 x 5 mm., ± 10 mm.
The trunk is stout, erect , solitary, covered by the persistent leaf-bases above, bare below, dark grey-brown and ringed.
Fruits glossy red to black.
E. guineensis is a monoecious, erect, one-stemmed palm tree, usually 20-30 m high, with an adventitious root system that forms a dense mat in the upper 35 cm of the soil with only a few roots penetrating deeper than 1 m. The stem is cylindrical, up to 75 cm in diameter and covered with petiole bases in young palms, smooth in older trees.
Mature palms are single-stemmed, and can grow well over 20 m tall.
Fruits are up to 5 cm long, ovoid, and black or red.
Physiology and Phenology The stem has a single growing point from which a leaf primordium develops about every second week.
Tree, Solitary palm.
The fruits are born in large clusters of 200-300, close to trunk on short heavy stalks.
Male and female flowers in separate clusters, but on same tree.
Stem solitary, erect, to 10 m tall, ca.
About 5 female inflorescences are produced per year, each.inflorescence weighing about 8 kg, the fruits weighing about 3.5 g each.
Seedling growth arrested below.15°C.
In the first 2 years, lateral growth of the trunk dominates, giving a broad base up to 60 cm in diameter.
Leaves are large, compound , the lower segments as spines on the leaf stalk margin, segments many, irregularly divergent , somewhat clustered in 4's or 5's.
Morphology Page fan palm feather palm palmate leaf costapalmate leaf costapalmate closeup pinnate leaf bipinnate leaf praemorse leaflets leaf folds inflorescence branching.
Fruit partially enclosed in the enlarged calyx and corolla, tipped by stylar remains, very variable in size, ± 3-5.5 x 2-3 cm., somewhat asymmetrical, usually bright orange with dark red, almost black pigmentation in the exposed upper parts, mesocarp ±
Product Description.3 seeds per pack.
The leaves are pinnate and reach 3-5 meters long.
Pisifera ,.shell-less, with small kernels in fertile fruits, fruits often rotting.prematurely, fruit to bunch ratio low, infertile palms show strong vegetative.growth, but of little commercial value, but has now become of greatest.importance in breeding commercial palms.
Flowers and fruit: Inflorescences are branched to one order and are 25-30 cm long.
Solitary, erect, palm with stem sometimes bulging near the middle and covered with woody, ridged, somewhat triangular leaf scars, clustered, plumose leaflets.
Robust tree palm, in cultivated specimens often flowering while still trunkless.
Lower leaflets wither, leaving sturdy midribs on a rounded base functioning as spines on the petiole.
Reproductive Biology Flowers are unisexual, with female flowers grouped in clusters of 200-300 close to the trunk at the end of short heavy pedicels, with male flowers borne in spikes.
Temperature of 35°.C stimulates germination in.thin shelled varieties.
Diploid , with a diploid number of 2n = 32.
After that, the trunk starts growing in height, 35-75 cm per year, reducing its diameter up to 40 cm.
Broadleaved Perennial Seed propagated Tree Woody.
Tropical Fruit Ci-E.
Inflorescence large, head -like, with spiny tipped branches borne close to the trunk, among the leaves, The fruits are green turning orange later.
Inflorescences either male or female, or rarely bearing both male and female, or even more rarely with hermaphrodite flowers, individual palms passing through alternating phases of male and female inflorescence production.
All leaf bases contain inflorescence primordia, but the first fully developed inflorescence does not appear before leaf 20 and usually much later, some 3 years after germination.
Tropical Fruit A-Ch.
Female flower accompanied by 2 usually abortive male flowers and 2 bracteoles, sepals ±10x 4 mm.
Female inflorescence more massive than the male, rachillae much shorter, the spine-like tip to 2 cm.
Often these are eliminated by removal of the.early female inflorescences.
Trunk to 30 m. tall, usually much less, 30-50 cm.
The palm fruit is reddish, about the size of a large plum, and grows in large bunches.
Small, distorted leaves resembling those due to a boron deficiency emerge.
Grows to 40-60 feet.
It is reddish, about the size of a large plum, and grows in large bunches.
Mature palms are single-stemmed and grow to 20 meters tall.
Leaves to 5 m long, pinnae 100 or more on each side, inserted in groups and spreading in different planes.
The flowers are produced in dense clusters, each individual flower is small, with three sepals and three petals.
Tropical Fruit S-Z.
Male flower with 3 chaffy cucullate sepals to 2 x 1.5 mm., and 3 chaffy acute petals to 2 x 1.5 mm., androecial tube to 2.5 mm.
A young palm produces about 30 leaves a year.
From leaf primordium to fully expanded leaf takes about 2 years.
Tenera , with thin shells,.0.5-3 mm thick, 1-32% of weight of fruit, medium to high mesocarp 60-95% of.weight of fruit, kernels 3-15% of fruit, larger number of bunches than Dura,.but lower mean bunch weight and lower fruit to bunch ratio.
The petiole is armed with spines along the margins, and the drooping, linear , green leaflets are irregularly arranged in clusters and spread in several planes.
Solitary, erect, to 15 m tall and 60 cm in diameter, sometimes bulging near the middle, covered with old, woody, ridged, somewhat triangular leaf scars.
Elaeis oleifera, the American Oil Palm, but this species is shorter, has a more creeping than upright stem, and leaflets that are regularly arranged and spread in the same plane.
Crown massive, consisting of 40-50 expanded leaves in a 8/13 phyllotaxis.
The fruits are plum-like, ovoid - oblong to 3.5 cm long and about 2 cm wide, black when ripe, red at base, with thick ivory-white flesh and small cavity in centre.
Leaves: Pinnate , reduplicate , with a graceful, arched rachis.
Each fruit is made up of an oily, fleshy outer layer , with a single seed , also rich in oil.
Juvenile leaves are lanceolate and entire but gradually becoming pinnate, mature leaves spirally arranged, paripinnate, up to 7.5 m long, petiole 1-2 m long, spinescent, clasping the stem at base, leaflets linear, 35-65 x 2-4 cm, up to 376 per leaf.
Fruits are ovoid-oblong drupes, 2-5 cm long, tightly packed in large ovoid bunches with 1000-3000 fruits, drupes with a thin exocarp, an oleiferous mesocarp and a lignified endocarp containing the kernel with embryo and solid endosperm.
The palm fruit takes 5-6 months to develop from pollination to maturity.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

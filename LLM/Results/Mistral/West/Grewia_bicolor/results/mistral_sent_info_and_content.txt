We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Grewia bicolor.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

On withered flowers the pale, greenish cream sepals fold in around the fruit beginnings during the second and final stage of their protective duties.
The greyish green leaves are alternately arranged and are covered in fine hairs and it appears to be a lighter shade of green on the underside of the leaves.

Sepals up to 12 mm long, linear-oblong or spathulate-oblong, slightly hooded at the apex, grey or brownish green tomentellous outside, yellow and glabrous inside.
The grey bark on the young branches, which is usually covered with thick-growing but quite short hairs, tends to turn dark grey and becomes smooth the older the tree gets, this is also noticeable on the stems.
Flowers yellow to orange, sepals 6-11 mm long, petals oblong, 3-8 mm long, acute to emarginate at the apex.
The flowers are small, bright yellow, borne in axillary clusters at the end of branches.
Flowers yellow, 1.5 cm in diameter, in axillary heads, often in profusion.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

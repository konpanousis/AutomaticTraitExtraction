Grewia bicolor is a multi-stemmed shrub or small tree, up to 9 m high.
There is a consistent angle between flower stalks of the same cluster.
The many stamens spread in a cluster around the style that is tipped with a globular green stigma.
On withered flowers the pale, greenish cream sepals fold in around the fruit beginnings during the second and final stage of their protective duties.
The greyish green leaves are alternately arranged and are covered in fine hairs and it appears to be a lighter shade of green on the underside of the leaves.
The fruits are round, fleshy drupes , reddish brown or orange and black when ripe, entire or deeply 2- lobed, up to 6 mm in diameter.
Sepals up to 12 mm long, linear-oblong or spathulate-oblong, slightly hooded at the apex, grey or brownish green tomentellous outside, yellow and glabrous inside.
The grey bark on the young branches, which is usually covered with thick-growing but quite short hairs, tends to turn dark grey and becomes smooth the older the tree gets, this is also noticeable on the stems.
Flowers yellow to orange, sepals 6-11 mm long, petals oblong, 3-8 mm long, acute to emarginate at the apex.
The flowers are small, bright yellow, borne in axillary clusters at the end of branches.
Flowers yellow, 1.5 cm in diameter, in axillary heads, often in profusion.
Fruit deeply divided into two globose lobes, each c. 6 mm.
A shrub or tree, up to 40 ft. high.

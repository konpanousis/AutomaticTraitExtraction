We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Parinari curatellifolia.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Parinari curatellifolia leaves.
Description.Parinari curatellifolia is a large, evergreen, spreading tree up to 20 m tall with a single bare stem and a dense, roundish to mushroom-shaped crown, bark dark grey and rough, young shoots densely covered with yellow woolly hairs.
Leaves alternate, simple, elliptic to oblong, 3-8 x 2-4 cm, leathery, dark green on top, finely velvety when young but losing these hairs later, densely hairy and grey to yellow underside, apex broadly tapering, often notched, base square, margin entire, petiole short.
The hard and woody endocarp is 2 cm in diameter, containing 1 or 2 embryos.
They often have small galls and up to 20 pairs of fusing lateral veins.
Within the fruit is the seed which is encapsulated by means of a lid or operculum.
Leaf dimensions are 3 cm to 8 cm by 2 cm to 4 cm.
The branching is low, and the bole twisted, 25-40cm in diameter.
The oval or rounded fruit which has a scaly texture, may take up to a year to ripen and is found at twig ends.
It is a creeping shrub which grows in dense groups, often occurring in rocky grasslands.
The leaf upper surface is glossy green, the lower one pale grey or yellowish and hairy.
The fruit is a drupe, and is yellow-orange with grey speckles when ripe.
In areas with high rainfall or more annually) it grows to its greatest size of about 20–22 metres with a crown around 20 metres across.
These simple and alternate leaves are inwardly folded with a base and tip fairly rounded and with a herringbone venation pattern visible on both surfaces.
Venation is ridged, raised on the upper surface, not quite reaching the margins.
These plum-like fruits are ± 50 mm long with a yellow edible flesh.
The leaves are distinctly bicoloured, having a white-silver undersurface and a dark green-grey upper surface.
Parinari curatellifolia , commonly known as the mobola plum or in Afrikaans the grysappel , is either a small shrub or a large evergreen, tropical tree with a rounded, mushroom-shaped crown reaching heights around 15 m.
Mature leaves appear to be darker and more rigid.
The bark is deeply fissured, with square or rectangular blackish scales and deep red slash.
This species is very variable in size and shape, ranging from small shrubs of 3m tall to large trees of up to 20m high.
Small to medium-sized evergreen tree with a distinct mushroom shape.
In areas with high rainfall or more annually) it grows to its greatest size of about 20-22 metres with a crown around 20 metres across.
It is a yellow-brown, fleshy drupe with scaly and pitted surface.
Parinari curatellifolia is an evergreen tropical tree of Africa , found in various kinds of deciduous woodland most frequently in poorly drained areas and inland at moderate altitudes.

Young shoots are densely covered with yellowish woolly hairs.
The tree is evergreen, with pale green, spreading foliage forming a dense, rounded, umbrella shaped crown, which casts heavy shade.
The leaf margins are entire and wavy, sometimes appearing slightly scalloped.

Glands are usually present at the stalk of the leaf or the leaf base.
It has rough, scaly skin, with golden coloured warts on the surface.
Petioles are short with an entire leaf margin and velvety hairs covering the surfaces of younger leaves.
Inflorescences are usually paired, terminal, many-flowered panicles of more or less lax cymes, up to 20cm long.
The sweetly scented inflorescences appear in shades of white, yellow or pink, and are covered in hairs.
It is an evergreen, medium to large tree, 10-13 m high, although heights of 23-26 m have been recorded in certain regions.

The branches are heavy and may droop or grow erect, giving the tree an impressive shape.
The occurrence of terminal panicles is common in the axils, primarily in the smaller leaves.
.Parinari curatellifolia is an evergreen tropical tree of Africa, found in various kinds of deciduous woodland most frequently in poorly drained areas and inland at moderate altitudes.
Leaf shape is somewhat oblong having a square base with much tapering at the apex.
The bark is rough and corky with yellow woolly hairs occasionally present in younger twigs and branches.
The bark is grey-brown to dark grey, rough and deeply furrowed.
It has rough, cork-like bark, stiff leather-like leaves which have grey hairs on the underside.
Each seed weighs 3-4 g.
The petiole is pubescent, 6-10mm long, with 2 circular glands.
The flowers are small, white to pink, the calyces and stalks covered in dense woolly, rust-coloured hairs.
Two small glands are sometimes present on or next to the leaf base.
The fruit is large and ovoid or round, up to 5 cm long.
The sweetly scented white flowers are tinged with pink, 4-6mm in diameter, with 5 petals and 5 sepals in compact heads.
The simple leaves of Parinari curatellifolia are alternate or spiralling around the stems on hairy petioles of 0,5 cm to 1 cm long.

It takes 9-10 months from flower fertilization to fruit ripening.
The fruit measures up to 50mm long by 30mm wide, with a hard stone embedded in a reddish thick fibrous pulp.
The leaf shape is elliptic to oblong and variable, the tip broadly tapering or notched, the base square, rounded or tapering.
Lateral veins ascend slightly in herringbone style from the midrib, close together and almost parallel.
The small, white, yellow or pink flowers are fragrant, growing from leaf axils in short, branched heads from midwinter to mid-spring.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

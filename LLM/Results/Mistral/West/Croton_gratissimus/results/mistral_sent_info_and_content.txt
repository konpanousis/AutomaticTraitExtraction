We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Croton gratissimus.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
It is capable of becoming a large tree in certain instances and it may reach 10m high if there is sufficient heat and rain.

The leaves are alternate, glossy bright green above.
Croton gratissimus' leaves are discolorous - olive-green above and silver below.
Rust-coloured flower buds, which are present throughout winter, open after the first rains.

Indigenous to South Africa, Croton gratissimus is a tall shrub or small tree that flourishes in a smaller garden.
The tree typically grows in a distinctive forked shape, with handsomely weeping, brittle branches and striking, glossy, egg-shaped leaves, which become particularly visible in windy weather.
The lower surface is  a striking silvery green and dotted with small, cinnamon-coloured scales.
The branches of this tree are brittle and have a drooping growth habit.
First green, it turns yellow as it matures.
Members have flowers that are typically unisexual, carried on the same plant, and have a high radial symmetry.
The lavender feverberry is a small tree that can either be deciduous or semi-deciduous depending on climatic and soil conditions.

Drooping spikes , of reddish-brown buds that remain closed and conspicuous on the tree during the dry season.
Spikes contain different sex flowers, with only one or two females at the bottom of the spike, and the rest are males.
Both sexes are carried together, and there are usually 1-2 female flowers towards the base, and the rest are male.
Capsule scaly, 1/3 in.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

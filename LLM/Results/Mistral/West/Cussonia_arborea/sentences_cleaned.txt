A deciduous savannah tree, leaves and flower-spikes clustered at the ends of the thick branches.
Leaves digitately compound , petiole up to 87 cm.
Robust tree up to 11 m.
The leaves are digitate or palmate with 5 to 9 ovate-elliptic leaflets and up to 20 inches long petioles.
The bark is rough, corky, and pale.
Flowering spikes up to about 20 together, mostly less than 10, up to 40 cm.
Stylopodium quite well developed, stigmatic surfaces very small, scarcely freely diverging at the tip.
Leaflets 5-9, up to 27 x 8 cm., sessile but with long, very narrowly tapering cuneate bases, chartaceous to somewhat coriaceous, glabrous or with occasional hairs, apex acute to acuminate, margins more or less regularly serrate-crenate to more or less entire, rarely deeply and jaggedly cut.
A tree to 11 m. tall with a bole of up to 0.75 m. diameter, bark deeply fissured and corky.
Leaves simple, deeply palmately lobed or digitately compound with sessile leaflets, petiole up to 45 cm.
Flowers sessile with floral bracts that are conspicuous in the unexpanded spikes, but insignificant and more or less caducous before maturity.
Their usually dense inflorescences are often spiked, and their small flowers usually have 5 greenish petals.
The leaves are carried on long petioles, and have conspicuous stipules.
Flowers greenish-white.
Their leaves are typically grouped in umbrella-shaped arrangements at the tips of long erect branches.
Leaves digitate or palmate with 5-9 ovate-elliptic leaflets, margin crenate or dentate, sometimes entire, petiole up to 50 cm long.
The bark is rough, corky, and pale brown.
Flowers are small and borne in terminal clusters on slender, up to 20 inches long spikes.
Flowering spikes up to 26 together, but frequently of c. 10-12, at first short and congested, but elongating as the flowers mature, and further as the fruit develop, up to 50 cm.
The leaves are very variable in shape, often palmately compound with leaflets likewise variable in shape, but also simple or palmate.
Cussonia arborea is a deciduous tree that grows up to 43 feet tall.
The fruits are spherical, up to 0.2 inches in diameter, thinly fleshy, purple when ripe, and borne along the elongated spikes.
Axis of the spike densely puberulous, basal bracts broadly triangular.
Bark rough and corky, pale brown.
Flowering spikes up to about 26 together, but mostly less than 12, up to 46 cm.
Flowers small, borne in terminal clusters of slender spikes up to 50 cm long.
Ripe fruits whitish.
Fruit ovoid-cylindrical to subglobose, 4-5.5 x up to 4 mm., glabrous or more rarely puberulous.
Small to medium sized deciduous tree.
A tree up to 13 m. tall, with a bole up to 1 m. or more in diameter, bark thick and fissured, dark grey to reddish-grey.
Fruit borne along the elongated spikes, spherical, c. 5 mm in diameter, thinly fleshy, purple when ripe.

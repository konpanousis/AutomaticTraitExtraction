Fruit ovoid 25 x 35 mm, 4-winged, yellow green flushed with reddish brown, drying to light brown.
Young fruits red and very glutinous, becoming pale brown.
Leaves usually in whorls of 3-4, rarely opposite, ovate, ovate-elliptic, dark green, velvety when young, losing most hairs at maturity, 7-10 pairs of lateral veins prominent below, margin entire, sometimes wavy.
Savannah tree, to 25 ft. high.
Flowers greenish cream to pale yellow, in dense, often branched spikes, appearing before or with the new leaves.
Lower receptacle usually tomentose, upper receptacle infundibuliform to broadly campanulate at the base and cupuliform at the apex, 2-3 mm.
Inflorescences axillary, either single simple spikes or clusters of such spikes borne on very much reduced axillary shoots or single axillary spikes on elongated shoots that are leafless at flowering thus giving the appearance of a branched inflorescence, both short and elongated shoots densely yellow-brown pubescent.
Disk with pilose free margin.
Fruit an almost circular to elliptical, 4-winged nut, 2.5-3.5 x 2.5-3 cm, with 5-7 mm long stipe and up to 12 mm broad wings, brown to reddish-yellow, sticky and slightly scaly, indehiscent, 1-seeded.
Cotyledons 2, 2 x 3 cm., transversely elliptic, arising as in the sectional description.
Disk with a pilose free margin.
Fruit brown or reddish-yellow, 2.5-3.5 x 2.5-3 cm.
Flowers sessile, greenish or dirty-white or yellow.
Sepals 1 x 1.5 mm., broadly triangular.
Small tree up to 10 m. high, bark grey, reticulately fissured, branches peeling to give dark reddish brown colour, branchlets glabrous, glutinous or pubescent.
Small to medium-sized tree.
Deciduous shrub or small tree up to c. 10 m. high, crown obovoid or rounded, bark creamy-brown or grey-brown, vertically cracked, scaly, exuding gum.
Petals and filaments cream or yellow.
Leaves opposite or very frequently 3-1-verticillate, lamina up to 20 x 9 cm., usually glutinous especially when young, ovate or ovate-elliptic, tomentose to nearly glabrous and lepidote , apex acute to rounded, base usually cuneate, lateral nerves 7-10 pairs, rather prominent beneath, petiole up to 1.5 cm.
Petals 2-3x 1-1.5 mm., cuneate or spathulate to obovate, glabrous.
Seedling with hypogeal germination, cotyledons transversely elliptical.
Sepals broadly triangular.
Flowers greenish yellow to white becoming yellow, fragrant.
Inflorescences an axillary spike on elongated shoots or clusters of spikes on reduced axillary shoots, giving the appearance of a panicle, spike up to 7 cm long, shoots densely yellow-brown short-hairy.
Leaves in whorls of 3-4 or sometimes opposite, simple and entire, stipules absent, petiole up to 1.5 cm long, leaving a prominent circular scar, blade narrowly to broadly ovate-elliptical to ovate, up to 15 cm x and 9 cm, apex acute or obtuse, base cuneate, papery to leathery, usually with sticky exudate, especially when young, sparsely scaly above, densely scaly beneath, but often very difficult to see due to the glutinous exudation, pinnately veined with 7-10 pairs of lateral veins, usually prominent on both surfaces, reticulation slightly raised beneath.
Scales as for the section.
Cotyledons 2, arising below soil-level and borne above ground on a long stalk formed by the connate petioles.
Leaves opposite or 3-verticillate, lamina papyraceous to coriaceous, narrowly to broadly ovate-elliptic to ovate, up to 15 cm.
Description     Small, deciduous tree up to 10 m tall, crown obovoid to rounded, bark grey-brown to creamy-brown, vertically fissured, exuding gum, branchlets glabrous to short-hairy, sticky or not.
They are: leaves pubescent, broadly elliptic, broadest at or slightly above the middle, obtuse at apex, petiole relatively short, flowers densely hairy leaves glabrous, broadly lanceolate, broadest below the middle, acute or acuminate at apex, margin markedly undulate, petiole relatively long, flowers densely hairy leaves as in B, but flowers sparsely pubescent leaves as in A, but glabrous except for conspicuous tufts in tlie axils of the main lateral nerves, flowers sparsely pubescent.
Fruit subcircular to elliptic in outline, 2.5-3.5 cm.
Inflorescences of axillary spikes up to 7 cm.
Petals cuneate or spathulate to obovate, 2-3 mm.
Stamen-filaments 5-6 mm.
The larger patches of mauve to dark.

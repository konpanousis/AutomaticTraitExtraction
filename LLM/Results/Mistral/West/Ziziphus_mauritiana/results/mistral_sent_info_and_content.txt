We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Ziziphus mauritiana.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Plants are capable of seed production once they reach a height of about 1 metre.
Ziziphus oenopolia is a straggly shrub with alternately arranged leaves.
The fruit consists of a large hard stone surrounded by a white fleshy pulp and a surface skin.
Varietal behaviour under varying powdery mildew pressure in jujube.
Leaves variable, alternate, in 2 rows, oblong-elliptic, 2.5-6 x 1.5-5 cm, with tip rounded or slightly notched base, finely wavy-toothed on edges, shiny green and hairless above, dense, whitish, soft hairs underneath.-Â¦ Read more.
Ziziphus mauritiana is a spiny, evergreen shrub or small tree up to 15 m high, with trunk 40 cm or more in diameter, spreading crown, stipular spines and many drooping branches.
It has a round, spreading crown.
Older stems have a dark grey to blackish coloured bark that is rough and somewhat furrowed.

Unripe fruit, cut to show the pit in the middle.
Its fruit turn bright orange when ripe and, unlike these other species, they are hard-shelled berries containing several flattened seeds in a soft white pulp.
Its leaves are green on both surfaces and its relatively small fruit turn black when ripe.
Its leaves have green upper surfaces and whitish or rusty lower surfaces and its relatively small fruit turn reddish, purplish or black in colour when ripe.
It is a fast-growing tree with a medium lifespan, that can quickly reach up to 10-40 ft tall.
The stone in the fruit is irregularly furrowed and usually contains two cells and two seeds , which have papery testa.
Old leaves fall in March to April and new leaves appear almost simultaneously.
Stems and Leaves The young stems have a zig-zagging nature, are finely hairy and are greenish or whitish in colour.
Fruits at various stages of ripeness, with cracked pit showing the two seeds.
The twigs are usually softly tomentose when young.
It can be oval, obovate, oblong or round, and can be 1-2.5 in long, depending on the variety.
Thus, the tree is leafless for only a short period, except in dry areas.

It is dark-green and glossy on the upper side and pubescent and pale-green to grey-green on the lower side.
The fruit is a soft, juicy, drupe that is 2.5 cm diameter, though in some cultivars the fruit size may reach up to 6.25 cm long and 4.5 cm wide.
Flowers appear in July to October and the fruit forms soon after, remaining green for about 4 months before turning yellowish on ripening in February to March.
Fully ripe fruits are less crisp and somewhat mealy, overripe fruits are wrinkled, the flesh buff-coloured, soft, spongy and musky.
The fully mature fruit is entirely red, soft, juicy with wrinkled skin and has a pleasant aroma.
The leaves are solitary or in pairs, from 2 to 6 cm in length and 1.5-5.9 cm at the widest point.
The bark is dark grey, dull black or reddish with long vertical fissures, reddish and fibrous inside.
But this tree can grow to 15 meters and has many branches and branches that are very numerous and thorny.
Product Description Z. mauritiana is a spiny, evergreen shrub or small tree up to 15 m high, with trunk 40 cm or more in diameter, spreading crown, stipular spines and many drooping branches.
There is a single, hard, oval or oblate, rough central stone which contains 2 elliptic, brown seeds, 1/4 in long.
Its leaves have green upper surfaces and whitish or rusty lower surfaces and its relatively large fruit turn yellowish, orange or reddish-brown in colour when ripe.
Bidar leaf shape is oval with shiny green color.
The fruit's skin is smooth, glossy, thin but tight.
The fruits on wild plants reach about 2 cm in diameter, and on cultivated varieties can exceed 5 cm long.
The form may be oval, obovate, round or oblong, the skin smooth or rough, glossy, thin but tough.
Flowers are minute, greenish-white or yellow, hermaphrodite, in sessile or shortly peduncled axillary cymes, and are insect pollinated with an acrid smell.
The species varies widely in height, from a bushy shrub 1.5 to 2 m tall, to a tree 10 to 12 m tall with a trunk diameter of about 30 cm.
Ziziphus mauritiana is a medium-sized tree that grows vigorously and has a rapidly developing taproot, a necessary adaptation to drought conditions.
These leaves are relatively small  and somewhat oval in shape or egg-shaped in outline.
A thorny and densely branched large shrub or small tree, with a spreading habit, growing 3-10 m tall and up to 10 m across.
Unknown plants or plants without names.
The fruit is of variable shape and size.
It is a fast growing tree with a medium lifespan, that can quickly reach up to 10-40 ft tall.
The leaves are about 2.5 to 3.2 cm long and 1.8 to 3.8 cm wide having fine tooth at margin.
These flowers are usually arranged in small loose clusters in the leaf forks , with each cluster usually containing 10-15 flowers.
It can be oval, obovate, oblong or round, and that can be 1-2.5 in long, depending on the variety.
Z. mauritiana is a small to medium-sized, single or multi-stemmed, spiny shrub or tree, which is almost evergreen, but is deciduous during the dry season.
Flowers and Fruit The inconspicuous flowers are greenish, greenish-yellow or whitish in colour.
The fruit is initially green and turns yellow, orange and red on ripening, being a drupe containing sour-sweet pulp and a hard stone.
Bark dark grey or dull black, irregularly fissured.
It can reach up to 12 m tall and 30 cm diameter at breast height, but is highly variable in size and general appearance.
The leaves are simple, shining green above and whitish tomentose beneath, due to persistent dense hairs , margins minutely serrulate, leaf shape ranging from almost round to an elongated ellipse, commonly sub-orbicular to ovate-oblong, rounded at both ends, highly variable in shape and size but always with three basal nerves and two stipular spines, one long and straight, the other small and curved back, and often brown in colour.
The alternately arranged leaves are borne on stalks 2-16 mm long.
It varies in size from 1.2 to 3.7 cm long, and is generally globose or ovoid, and glossy.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

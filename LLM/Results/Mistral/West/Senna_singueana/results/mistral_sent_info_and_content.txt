We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Senna singueana.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Senna singueana or Winter Cassia as it is commonly known is a small deciduous tree up to 4 meters in height with large leaflets and awesome deep yellow flowers in abundant sprays from autumn to spring.
Leaves arranged spirally, paripinnately compound with 5-12 pairs of leaflets, stipules linear-lanceolate, acuminate, soon falling, leaflets elliptical, oblong-elliptical to obovate-elliptical, 2.5-6.5 cm x 1.5-3 cm, unequal at base, mostly rounded or notched at apex, glabrous to hairy on both sides.
Botany     Deciduous shrub or small tree up to 15 m tall.
Fruit a cylindrical to slightly compressed, straight or slightly twisted, oblong pod 5-25 cm x 0.5-1 cm, slightly constricted between the seeds, indehiscent, apex rounded and shortly pointed, 8-25-seeded.
Stamens:3 lower with large anthers and long filaments, 4 with somewhat shorter anthers and short filaments, 3 upper with reduced anthers.
Leaflets 6-10 pairs, elliptic, oblong-elliptic or obovate-elliptic, 2.5-6.3 cm.
Branchlets glabrous to densely pubescent.
Inflorescences racemose or paniculate, terminal and axillary, usually with at least some opposite branches, primary inflorescence branches up to 5 cm long at first anthesis, later elongating, proximal bracts of racemes ovate, early caducous, with pairs of stalked glands persisting beside the scar, proximal pedicels up to 5 cm long at anthesis, distal ones shorter.
The leaves are pinnate with opposite paired leaflets.
Shrub or small tree 1-15 in.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

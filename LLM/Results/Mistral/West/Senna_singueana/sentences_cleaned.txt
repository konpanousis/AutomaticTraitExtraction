Usually a small tree 2-6 m high.
Bark prominently vertically and horizontally fissured with x rectangular plates.
Sepals rounded at apex.
Inflorescence a stalked, terminal raceme up to 15 cm long, 6-many-flowered, bracts 9-27 mm long.
Arg by seeds and stem cuttings, MSc.
The fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds.
Perennial, Not climbing, Shrub/Tree.
Branchlets brown, lenticellate, glabrous to pubescent, longitudinally ridged when young, cracking and exfoliating when older.
Flowers bisexual or female, zygomorphic, 5-merous, sepals oblong-obovate, up to 14 mm long, petals unequal, oblong to obovate, 1.5-3 cm long, yellow, stamens 10, the 3 lower ones largest and fertile, 7 sterile, ovary superior, c. 2 cm long, stipitate, down-curved.
Seed germinates in about 9 days with an average germination rate of 78%.
Seeds compressed, round, 5-6 mm in diameter, with a small areole on each face.
These are followed by long yellow pods.
Tree, shrub over 2 m.
Stamens 10, three large with arcuate fertile anthers 10-12 mm long and filaments 5-6 mm long, four fertile with almost straight anthers 6-8 mm
Seeds brown, in a single row, 5-6 mm in diameter, subcircular, flattened, with two elliptic 1-2 mm long pale areoles.
Racemes 6- to many-flowered, usually pedunculate and ± corymbose, often aggregated towards branchlet-ends and often produced when the plant is leafless, their axes bear conspicuous glands similar to those on the leaf-rhachides.
Leaves paripinnate with erect stalked glands on the rhachis between each pair of leaves.
Ovary 10-12 mm long, straight or curved, terete, glabrous to appressed-pubescent with white hairs, style 4-5 mm long, terete, glabrous, stigma terminal, recessed, surrounded by a fringe of hairs.
Sepals 5, three larger c.13 x 11 mm, three smaller c.8 x 7 mm, broadly elliptic to subcircular, glabrous or nearly so.
Leaf indumentum variable ranging from glabrous to hairy.
The flowers have two sets of stamen: feeding stamens, which are longer, and pollinating stamens, which are smaller in size.
Pods linear, straight or somewhat twisted, torulose, subcylindric or slightly compressed, 5.5-26 cm.
Petals golden yellow, unequal, clawed, the two largest up to 25 x 18 mm, oblong, one somewhat asymmetrical, rounded and undulate-dentate at apex, the others smaller, broadly elliptic to oblong, rounded at apex.
Senna , the sennas , is a large genus of flowering plants in the legume family.
Pod blackish, 10-25 x 0.8-1 cm, linear, straight or irregularly curved or twisted, chambered, glabrous, indehiscent.
Morphology Branchlets brown, lenticellate, glabrous to pubescent, longitudinally ridged when young, cracking and exfoliating when older.
The inflorescences are racemes at the ends of branches or emerging from the leaf axils.
Copious yellow flowers.
Leaves:petiole eglandular , rhachis with a conspicuous fusiform or stipitate gland between each pair of leaflets except often the terminal.
The stem bark contains tannins and is astringent.
The wood is pale brown.
Seeds dull brown, almost circular, flattened, ± 5-6 mm.

Senna singueana or Winter Cassia as it is commonly known is a small deciduous tree up to 4 meters in height with large leaflets and awesome deep yellow flowers in abundant sprays from autumn to spring.
Leaves arranged spirally, paripinnately compound with 5-12 pairs of leaflets, stipules linear-lanceolate, acuminate, soon falling, leaflets elliptical, oblong-elliptical to obovate-elliptical, 2.5-6.5 cm x 1.5-3 cm, unequal at base, mostly rounded or notched at apex, glabrous to hairy on both sides.
Botany     Deciduous shrub or small tree up to 15 m tall.
Fruit a cylindrical to slightly compressed, straight or slightly twisted, oblong pod 5-25 cm x 0.5-1 cm, slightly constricted between the seeds, indehiscent, apex rounded and shortly pointed, 8-25-seeded.
Stamens:3 lower with large anthers and long filaments, 4 with somewhat shorter anthers and short filaments, 3 upper with reduced anthers.
Leaflets 6-10 pairs, elliptic, oblong-elliptic or obovate-elliptic, 2.5-6.3 cm.
Branchlets glabrous to densely pubescent.
Inflorescences racemose or paniculate, terminal and axillary, usually with at least some opposite branches, primary inflorescence branches up to 5 cm long at first anthesis, later elongating, proximal bracts of racemes ovate, early caducous, with pairs of stalked glands persisting beside the scar, proximal pedicels up to 5 cm long at anthesis, distal ones shorter.
The leaves are pinnate with opposite paired leaflets.
Shrub or small tree 1-15 in.

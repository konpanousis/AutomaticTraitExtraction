We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Ficus platyphylla.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Rusty or pinkish-brown bark and large grey scaly patches.
Calyptra flattened, conical, very early shed.
Foliage and figs often tinged pink.
Tree up to 15 m. tall, terrestrial.
Leaves alternate, stipules lateral, free, 0.8-3.5 cm long, hairy, petiole up to 12 cm long, pubescent, blade leathery, drying dark green, ovate-elliptic to rarely obovate, 5-25 x 3-17 cm, base deeply cordate, often with ± overlapping basal lobes, margin entire, apex rounded or obtuse, glabrescent above, pubescent to glabrescent below, venation as in F. populifolia, midrib with 9-11 pairs of lateral veins and glandular tissue below at the leaf base.
All figs present a white to yellowish latex , some in copious quantities, the twig shows paired stipules -or circular scars if the stipules have fallen off, the lateral veins at the base of the leaf are steep, forming a tighter angle with the midrib than the other lateral veins, a feature referred to as "triveined".
Figs up to 5 together in the leaf-axils or just below the leaves, peduncle 1-2.5 cm.
Figs 1 or more in the leaf axils, on peduncles 2-5 cm long, slender, pubescent, basal bracts 2, ovate, united at the base, apical part caducous, receptacle globose, c. 1 cm in diam., pubescent, ostiole not prominent, 2-lipped, without visible bracts.
Nearly half of fig species are gynodioecious, and therefore have some plants with inflorescences with long styled pistillate flowers, and other plants with staminate flowers mixed with short styled pistillate flowers.
The many small flowers are unseen unless the fig is cut open.
Fig plants can be monoecious or gynodioecious.
Tree up to c. 20 m tall, with spreading crown, trunk up to 1 m in diam., bark pale brown, scaly, fissured.
The stipule of Ficus religiosa.
Ficus superba variation henneana Corner.
Often epiphytic at first.
The white stipule contains a new leaf and a new stipule.
Receptacle globose, 1-2 cm.
Young branches thick, with brown bark, puberulous to glabrescent.
The fruit typically has a bulbous shape with a small opening at the outward end that allows access to pollinators.
Pubérulent, épais, de 4-12 cm de long, canaliculé dessus.
The genus Dorstenia , also in the fig family , exhibits similar tiny flowers arranged on a receptacle but in this case the receptacle is a more or less flat, open surface.
A large savannah tree, to 60 ft. high.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

G. sepium forms a small to medium-sized, thornless, deciduous, single- or multiple-stemmed tree, 2-15 m and occasionally 20 m tall, and 5-30 cm and occasionally 1 m in stem diameter, with an open rounded crown, often greatly modified by lopping.
Defoliation Gliricidia tolerates repeated cutting very well.
The small flowers are pale pink and they are borne in dense clusters on bare twigs.
Leaflets are narrowly elliptic to elliptic, rarely broadly elliptic, usually pointed at tips, 4.4-8.3 cm long, 1.7-4.8 cm wide, larger towards tip of the leaf, with characteristic dark purplish tannin patches scattered, especially on lower surface.
Leaves are odd-pinnate, usually alternate, sub-opposite or opposite, and approximately 30 cm long.
The standard petal is light pink, or pink with a deep yellow basal blotch, and the blade is reflexed at 180° when the flower is fully open.
It may be either a single or multiple stem tree with trunk diameters reaching 30 cm.

The bark is grayish-brown to whitish and may be deeply furrowed on old, large diameter trees.
Decals en skins.
Leaves bright green above, pale below, crushed leaf smells strong.
The tree's fruit is a pod about 10-15 cm long.
There are 10 whitish stamens, 9 united into a tube and one free.
The pods are 10-17 cm long and 1.4-2.2 cm wide, strongly compressed, green sometimes tinged maroon and fleshy unripe, drying mid yellow-brown when ripe, and opening explosively when dry with the pod valves twisting into tight spirals after dehiscence.
The green succulent pods turn woody and yellow with maturity, which requires 35 to 60 days.
Flowers bright pink to lilac, tinged with white, usually with a diffuse pale yellow spot at the base of the standard petal , calyx glabrous , green, often tinged red.

Fruit A pod, oblong, continuous between seeds.
Fruit green, sometimes tinged reddish-purple when unripe, light yellow-brown when mature, narrow, 10-18 cm long, 2 cm wide, valves twisting in dehiscence, seeds 4-10, yellow-brown to brown, nearly round.
Trees are deciduous, losing some or all of their leaves during the dry season, and flowering and fruiting while leafless.

Gliricidia sepium, often simply referred to as its genus name Gliricidia, is a medium size leguminous tree belonging to the family Fabaceae.
Seed is yellow to brown in color with 4,500 to 11,000/kg.
There are 7 to 25 leaflets per leaf and size increases towards the tip.
Leaflets are generally opposite in arrangement, oblong in shape and pointed at the tip.
The flowers are typical of Papilionoid legumes, borne on short 5-11 mm long slender pedicels, 2 cm long, with a five-lobed campanulate calyx and a typical pea-shaped whitish-pink or purple corolla with five strongly unequal petals.
The flowers are borne on erect, 2-15 cm long racemes arising from leaf axils, or on leafless nodes of older stems with almost synchronous maturation of 30-100 flowers on a single inflorescence.

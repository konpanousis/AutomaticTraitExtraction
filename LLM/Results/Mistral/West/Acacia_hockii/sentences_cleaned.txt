A. hockii twigs are usually more elongate, slender and puberulous than those of A. seyal , and have reddish or brownish bark which does not peel to expose the inner layer, a characteristic of A. seyal.
A. hockii may be confused with the closely related A. seyal , as both share similarly coloured peeling bark, tree form, size and general morphology.
The thorns are spinescent stipules, short , straight, suberect or spreading, subulate or flattened on the upper side, with -ant-galls- and other prickles absent.
Leaves with 2-11 pairs of pinnae, leaflets in 9-29 pairs.
Stipules spinescent, mostly short, straight, suberect or spreading, to 2 cm.
Flowers are bright yellow or orange, in axillary, pedunculate heads 5-12 mm in diameter.
Tree, shrub over 2 m.
Young branchlets ± densely puberulous, rarely glabrous, with ± numerous reddish sessile glands, usually elongate and slender with reddish or brownish bark which does not peel to expose a powdery layer as in A. seyal.
Shrubs or small trees, bark peeling in papery layers, young twigs puberulous.
Inner bark is not powdery.
Seeds olive-brown, smooth, elliptic, compressed, 5-7 mm.
Seeds are olive-brown, 5-7 x 3-4 mm, smooth, elliptic and compressed.
Spines stipular, short, straight.
Young twigs and branchlets puberulous to densely puberulous, rarely glabrous, with sessile glands, reddish, sometimes numerous, usually elongate and slender.
Leaves often with a gland on the petiole and between the top 1 pairs of pinnae, pinnae 2-11 pairs, leaflets 9-29 pairs, 2-6.5 x 0.5-1 mm., usually ± densely ciliolate, sometimes glabrous, obtuse to acute but not spinulose-mucronate at the apex, lateral nerves invisible beneath.
A. hockii is a multi-stemmed shrub 2-4 m tall, or a small tree to 6-7 m tall with an open crown occasionally 9 m wide, with 12 m also recorded in exceptional individuals.
Broadleaved Perennial Seed propagated Shrub Tree Woody.

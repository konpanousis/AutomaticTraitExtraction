Lophira lanceolata is a small deciduous tree growing to a height of 16 m or more.
Petals obcordate, 1.7 cm long, 1.3 cm wide, glabrous.
This is followed by a partially woody, conical achene surrounded by a winged calyx , containing a single, large seed.
Fruit a conical, somewhat woody, 1-seeded achene surrounded by the calyx, outer sepals accrescent, wing-like, unequal, one 8-10 cm x 2-2.5 cm, the other 2.5-5 cm x 0.5-1 cm.
Sepals unequal, glabrous, 2 outer ovate-acuminate, 7-8 mm long, 4-5 mm wide, acute at apex, inner 3 broadly ovate, 6 mm long, 5 mm wide, obtuse at apex.
The fruits, which are wind-dispersed, contain a single, oil-rich seed in a conical capsule, which is brown when mature and is surrounded by two unequally-sized membranous -wings-, one up to six centimetres long and the other twice that size.
The inflorescence take the form of a loose panicle at the end of the shoot.

The tree has a narrow crown and steeply ascending branches, and forms suckers readily.
Leaves alternate but clustered at the end of branches, simple and entire, stipules linear-lanceolate, 3-5 mm long, caducous, petiole 2-6 cm long, blade oblong-lanceolate, 11-45 cm x 2-9 cm, base cuneate, often asymmetrical, apex rounded and sometimes notched, glabrous, red to bright pink when young, pinnately veined with numerous lateral veins, prominent on both sides.
The trunk is usually unbranched to around 8 m and can reach a diameter of about 70 cm.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.
Leaves red when young, oblong-lanceolate, 11-45 cm long, 2-9 cm wide, rounded to retuse at the apex, cuneate and often asymmetrical at base, entire, glabrous, lateral veins very numerous together with midrib prominent on both surfaces, petiole 2-6 cm long, stipules linear-lanceolate, 3-5 mm long, 0.7 mm wide, deciduous.
Individuals can grow to 3 m.
Lophira lanceolata known as -Iron wood- is a tree that grows up to 12m high, with a narrow crown, deep root, less scaly bark and contains no latex.
The leaves of the latter exude latex when damaged.
The bark is typically red-brown in colour, up to two centimetres thick, and has a bright yellow layer underneath.
Inflorescence a terminal, pyramidal, lax panicle 15-20 cm long, axes angular, grooved, glabrous.
The individual flowers are bisexual, scented and white, with parts in fives.
The flowers of L. alata are white, fairly large, strong-smelling, and grouped in loose, branched, terminal inflorescences.
Most of the seminiferous tubules were close together with regular outlines and narrow interstitium.
Description     Small to medium-sized tree up to 16 m tall, bole branchless for up to 7.5 m, straight or twisted, up to 70 cm in diameter, bark surface corky, grey, very coarsely flaking, inner bark yellow to brownish red, branches ascending, with prominent leaf-scars.

Ovary white, conical, 8 mm long, 3 mm wide, stigmas 1-2 mm long, ovules 8-16.
The bark is grey and corky, coming away in coarse flakes.
Flowering occurs in adult trees with trunks over 50 centimetres in diameter, and takes place from the time the new leaves appear.
Young trees under four metres in height have greenish-grey bark, which becomes pink or light brown as the tree matures.
Usually with gnarled trunk.
The leaves of L. alata are up to 25 centimetres long and are tough, fairly narrow and elongated, with a rounded or slightly indented tip, and tend to occur in clusters at the ends of the twigs.
When new leaves are expanding, it is easily recognizable from far by its new red leaves grouped at the ends of branches.
The new foliage is pink or red at first.
The leaves are clustered at the end of the twigs.
The trunk of Lophira alata is usually straight, without buttress roots , but sometimes with a swollen base, and is usually clear of branches up to about 30 metres.
Flowers white, scented, pedicels 1-1.5 cm long, jointed near apex, glabrous.
Seed 1, ovoid, 1.6 cm long, 8 mm wide.
The tree is very similar to the closely related Lophira alata but is smaller, has narrower leaves with longer stalks, and larger seeds.
Seed ovoid, c. 16 mm x 8 mm, chestnut-coloured, glabrous.
Petals white.
Clin Phytosci 6, 4.
Panicles profuse, terminal, pyramidal, lax, 15-20 cm long, axes angular, striate, glabrous.
Stamens with filaments white, 4-6 mm long and anthers orange, 4-5 mm long.
The colour is reddish brown and the wood is abrasive, dulling tools rapidly.
Lophira alata sheds all its leaves during a short period of one to two weeks, usually in December, and the re-growth of bright red young leaves, often simultaneously on all L. alata trees in an area, can set the canopy ablaze with colour.
Inside, the living sapwood is pale pink or whitish in colour, while the inner heartwood is dark red-brown to chocolate brown, with conspicuous white deposits of silica.
Fruits conical, 3 cm long, 1 cm wide, glabrous with unequal wing-like enlarged sepals, one 8-10 cm long, 2-2.5 cm wide and the other 2.5-5 cm long, 0.6-1 cm wide.
Savannah tree, to 40 ft. high.
They have simple , broad leaves.
Coarsely branched tree up to 9-16 m tall with clean bole up to 7.5 m tall, bark corky, grey, very coarsely flaking in small pieces, flakes brick-red to yellow beneath, brittle, slash bright yellow cork layer above, crimson-red granular beneath.
They are alternate, narrowly oblong, simple and entire, with rounded or notched apexes.

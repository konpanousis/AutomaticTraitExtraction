Weathered outer bark is grey in colour, fresh underlying bark is light brown.
The fruit is surrounded by a woody, cupshaped receptacle and contains numerous minute seeds.
Juvenile growth : stems square in cross-section, not or weakly winged , not warty, growing tips and young stems glaucous or non-glaucous, juvenile leaves always petiolate , opposite for a few nodes  then alternate, lanceolate to ovate , 9.7-15.5 cm long, 2-3.5 cm wide, flat or undulate margin, blue-green, blue-grey or glaucous.
When growing in drier woodlands on poor soils the Grey Gum is less than 20m tall and branches are held relatively close to the ground.
It has smooth white or cream-coloured bark, lance-shaped or curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven or nine, white flowers and hemispherical fruit with the valves extending beyond the rim.
Juvenile leaves are broader and up to 15cm long.
The fruit is more obconical than cup-shaped, as for E.propinqua , and measures about 8mm in diameter.
An intramarginal vein runs very close to the leaf edge and the mid rib is grooved on the upper surface.
Under favourable conditions the White Mahogany can reach a height of 60m with a trunk measuring up to 1.5m in diameter at the base.
The prominent operculum is beak-shaped.
It measures up to 15mm in length with mostly 3 rounded valves reaching the height of the broad rim.
It is shed in small irregular plates exposing dark grey coloured patches of fresh bark that cause the mottling effect.
Four deep seated valves release brown coloured seeds with a small surrounding flange.
The Spotted Gum C. maculata has a very similar appearance.
Bimodal Summer Uniform Winter.
Flower buds are distinctively cone shaped and up to 10mm long.
It is up to 15mm long with deeply sunken valves and a thick rim.
Adult leaves are lanceolate to narrowly lanceolate, acuminate, lamina 8-30 cm long, 0.7-2 cm wide, green or grey-green, concolorous, petioles terete or channelled, 1.2-1.5 cm long.
Eucalyptus camaldulensis has few equals.
Inflorescence axillary unbranched, peduncles 0.5-2.8 cm long, buds 7, 9 or 11 per umbel , pedicellate.
The shape of the fruit is varied from cup-shaped to more upside down cone-shaped.
On the mid-north coast of NSW, mature trees lose the rough bark at the base of the trunk nearly entirely.
Adult leaves are up to 20cm long, very narrow lanceolate , firm and strong in texture.
The anther sacs open into longitudinal slits to release their pollen.
Simple alternately arranged leaves are, up to 16cm long with entire margins, broadly lanceolate with entire margins, dark green, glossy above, paler green beneath, firm, leathery and scented when crushed.
The reddish brown bark is very stringy, fibrous in texture and can exude some resin.
The latter can be distinguished by its taller and more steeply branched habit, its acutely conical operculum and black, rough-coated seeds.

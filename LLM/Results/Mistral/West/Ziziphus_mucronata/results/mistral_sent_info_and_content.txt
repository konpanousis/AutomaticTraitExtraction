We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Ziziphus mucronata.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:

The Ziziphusmucronata also known as the Buffalo thorn is a small tree with a spreading canopy that has characteristic zigzag young twigs with two significant thorns at the node, with one facing forward and the other backwards.
The fruit takes the shape of a round berry that ripens to yellow and then dark brown.
The bark is a red-brown or roughly mottled grey, cracked in small rectangular blocks revealing a stringy red underbark.
Ziziphus mucronata is a very hardy, deciduous, small to medium sized tree with both hook and straight thorns.
From October to April the greenish yellow flowers with silvery sheen are found in dense bunches in the axils of the leaves.
Three distinct veins can be seen running from the faintly lobed, asymmetrical base, and the ultimate venation forms a fine, grid-like pattern when held against strong sunlight.
The thorns occur in pairs, the one is straight , the other sharply curved.
The bark becomes rough and turns to a dark grey or brown colour.
The foliage is a shiny, dark green and the leaves turn yellow to orange before dropping in autumn.

The shrub or tree has distinctive zigzag branchlets, armed with pairs of thorns, one hooked and the other straight.
The flowers are small and inconspicuous in most genera, but occasionally form striking, large clusters of flowers in others.
It is green and hairy when young and tends to retain branches close to the ground.
Small, greenish-yellow, insignificant flowers are borne in tight clusters above each leaf.
The main stem is typically twisted, either single or multi-stemmed, with drooping branches and a diameter of up to 500 mm.
The flowers are radially symmetrical, with 4-5 separate petals and an equal number of stamens opposite the petals.
The margins are wavy and finely serrated around the upper two-thirds.
The main stem is green and hairy when young, year old branches often zigzag, the bark is reddish brown or roughly mottled grey, cracked into small rectangular blocks, revealing a red and stringy under-surface.

Size 3 to 10m.
Young stems are reddish-brown and often grow in a distinct zigzag habit.
The thorns are found in pairs on the branches, one thorn being straight with one hooked.
In some instances adult trees lose their thorns completely.

Tree bears beautiful, glossy green leaves.
The flowers are silvery green in colour, found in dense bunches amongst the leaves.
An armed or unarmed, multi- or single stemmed shrub to medium sized tree, with sleek, elegant foliage, mottled, attractively flaking, russet-grey bark, a spreading or upright crown of beautifully weeping branches, and unconventional, zigzagging, thorny side twigs.

The petiole is 4-7 mm long and finely hairy.
Simple, broadly oval , alternately arranged leaves, growing from between the thorns.
The bark is rough and is dark grey to brown in colour.
It has attractive, small, yellowish flowers from October to January and hard, round, reddish-brown berries with a sweet, powdery pulp, which are known to be used as a kind of porridge.
Semi-rounded, russet-brown berries , with thinly leathery skins and a sparse layer of meal-like pulp.
The buffalo thorn is a small to medium size tree, reaching a height of about 10 metres , or rarely 17 metres.
They are a light, glossy green above, only slightly paler below, with short, soft, woolly or coarse brown hairs when young, or hairless.
This subspecies is mostly hairless except for short pubescence on the veins beneath.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

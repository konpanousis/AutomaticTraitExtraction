The trunk is broad and fluted and the crown rounded and heavy, with a bark that is smooth when young, but becomes rough and black with age.
The branches are dropping, the stems are thick and angular.
The flowers of S. guineense have white, showy stamens, in dense branched heads 10 centimeters across, yielding a honey-sweet smell that attracts many insects.
The young leaves are purple-red in color, but as they mature their color becomes dark green, the leaves in general are shiny and smooth on both surfaces, with a tip that is long but rounded, on a short grooved stalk.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Cassia sieberiana.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The tree has a relatively thin trunk with low branches and reddish-brown bark structurally.
It can grow to anywhere between 19 and 45 feet in height.
The lenticels are horizontal and a reddish color.
Its flowers appear in bright yellow panicles growing in a pyramid formation, and they bloom during spring and summer.
There are five sepals with 5 bracts.
The upper side of the leaf is moderately shiny while the bottom has very fine nerves with stipules that are deciduous.
The petals are 15-20 cm long while the green sepals are 6-7mm in length.
The tree develops pink flowers during the flowering season, which turn into cylindrical pods containing fruit later.
The tree is a semi-deciduous shrub with multiple branches that reaches a typical height of 16 feet.
Stamens 10, filaments of 3 lower each with an S-bend near base, without a swelling above.
Bark grey to brown or almost black.
The bark ranges from a dark grey to black.
The petals are 15-20 cm long while the green sepals are 6-7mm in length.
The seed pods it produces are dark and grow in stark contrast to its beautiful flowers.
Also known as the American sicklepod or coffee pod, it is a short-lived shrub that can grow up to 7 feet tall but is typically shorter than 5 feet.
The cassia grandis grows to a maximum height of 100 feet.
There are a total of 10 stamens.
Seeds not embedded in pulp, brown, ellipsoid or ovoid-ellipsoid, 8-9 x 4.5-7 x 2.5-4 mm., with slight reticulate cracking.
Petals yellow, 2-3.5 cm.
It flowers in the dry season and grows to a maximum height of 50 feet.
The majestic tropical tree grows long yellow to pink clusters of flowers, which are not exactly a whole rainbow.
Shrub or small tree 2-12 m. high.
Native to Thailand and Burma , the Pink Shower Tree blooms in the spring, creating flowers maturing from pink to white flowered trees eventually.
The Drumstick tree, or West African laburnum, peaks at 33 to 65 feet in height and grows in different clusters on the African continent.

The Chinese Senna is a smaller shrub, with yellow blooms.
Flowers are arranged either upright or in pendulous racemes ranging from 30-50 cm.
Individuals of this species are anywhere from 10-20m in height.
The fruit ranges from a dark brown to black color.
It ranges from 10-20 metres in height and has very bright yellow flowers.
It is a medium-to-large tropical tree that grows to around 40 ft, and most people commonly plant it for its beauty along streets and in parks in tropical regions.
However, the gold medallion tree is different as its yellow flowers bloom at scattered periods throughout the year.
Bracts persist-ing till the flowers are open.
Pods cylindrical, 30-90 cm.
Un essai visant x  rechercher une activite antivirale contre le virus Herpes simplex de type 1 a montre que les extraits de Cassia sieberiana avaient une activite significative contre ce virus.
Young branchlets rather densely pubescent.
The leaves are arranged in leaflets that contain 7-10 pair of opposite leaves.
Leaflets in usually 4-12 pairs , petiolulate, elliptic to ovate-elliptic or sometimes obovate-elliptic, 3.5-9.5 cm.
Flowers are arranged either upright or in pendulous racemes ranging from 30-50 cm.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

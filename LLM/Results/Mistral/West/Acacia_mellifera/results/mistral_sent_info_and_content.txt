We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Acacia mellifera.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Acacia mellifera is a dense thorny shrub native to many semi-arid regions in Africa and western Asia.
Senegalia mellifera   is a very thorny shrub or small tree with a rounded or spreading flat crown, occurring in bushveld and semidesert areas.
Leaves compound, rachis 2-5 cm long, slender, sparsely puberulous to glabrous, with 2-3 pairs of pinnae, 0.5-2.5 cm long, oblong to obovate-oblong, 5-10 x 2-5 mm, unequal at the base, rounded to acute-mucronate at apex, chartaceous, green initially, the same shade above and below, leaflet margins are sparsely fringed with white hairs, but become glaucous when older, main vein subcentral with 2 prominent accessory nerves ascending about 2/3rd way up the lamina, lateral nerves prominent.
Leaflet margins are sparsely fringed with white hairs.
Size 3 to 7m.
Branchlets flattened, 1.5-5 mm thick, glabrous, stipules deciduous, not spinescent, spines in pairs, 3-5 mm long, black, recurved and in pairs at nodes that are only 5-15 mm apart and thus there are more thorns per unit length of branch than with other species.
There are 2-3 pairs of leaflets per pinna, relatively large, 3.5-15 x 2-12 mm and 1-4 leaves per node.
It is noted by Nonyane to be similar to A. nigrescens , but A. mellifera has white lenticel markings on the young branches and lacks prickly knobs on the trunk and also has much shorter inflorescences and smaller, more papery pods and that are paler in colour.
Brasilia Tree habit Multistemmed habit of A. mellifera ssp.
Leaves are alternately arranged, double-compound.
This is a very thorny shrub to small tree with rounded or spreading flat crown which may reach down to ground level, occurring in bushveld and semi-desert areas, often on Kalahari sand and often growing in circular groups forming impenetrable thickets in overgrazed areas.
The flowers are cream to white, but they take on a brownish hue when fading.
Senegalia mellifera can occur either as a multi-trunked bush up to seven metres high with more or less a funnel-shaped crown, or as a single-trunked tree that can reach a height of up to nine metres.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Cordia africana is a species of flowering tree in the borage family, Boraginaceae , that is native to Africa.
.The relatively small and yellowish to dark brown when ripe stone fruit is at a length of about 12 mm and a diameter of about 8 mm ovoid to ellipsoid or obovate and running in a short tip.
Most alternate arranged leaves are stalked usually from 2 to 10 inches long.
It contains one or two large, pale brown seeds embedded in a jelly-like pulp.
Above all, both young branches the bark is partially hairy up significantly.

The simple, stiff leathery leaf blades are ovate to broadly ovate, sometimes elliptic to almost circular, with almost pointed or heart-shaped and often asymmetric Spreitenbasis and rounded and suddenly at a length of 6 to 21 centimeters and a width of 4 to 16.5 centimeters.short spitzzulaufendem or sometimes acute upper end.
Leaves alternate or sometimes almost ternate, petiole 2.5-10.5 cm.
The fruit drops from the tree before it is quite ripe, completing the ripening process on the ground.
The wood is light brown to brown.
Seeds 1-2, very rarely 3-4.
Flowers hermaphrodite, sweetly scented, sessile, hairy, having much the appearance of artificial flowers made of crinkly paper, massed in compact conspicuous panicles of scorpioid cymes up to 14 x 14 cm., shorter than the leaves.
The flower stalk is about 1 millimeter long.
Although it sheds its leaves in winter, the tree is still attractive, displaying its light brown trunk and branches majestically.
The leaves look somewhat similar to Cordia species.
Although the species belongs to the legume family, the fruit is pod-shaped only in a very juvenile stage.
Fruit c. 12 x 8 mm., ovoid, ellipsoid or obovoid, apiculate, glabrous, dark brown, surrounded at base by the widened cup-shaped calyx, pyrene subquadrangular in cross section.
The thin leaves are alternate, with a slightly toothed margin, shiny dark green above and paler green below.
On a 7-10 mm long filament sits a 2 to 2.5 mm long anthers.
The scented, cream-white, bell-shaped flowers are borne in clusters at the end of the branches in spring/early summer.
The bark is smooth with patches flaking off, leaving behind interesting natural scars.
They are pale to dark green above but matt, pale green beneath, with translucent dots scattered across the surface of the blades.
Cymes arranged in terminal leafy usually ample panicles, rhachis and branches tawny or brown, minutely tomentose.
The bark is gray to dark brown with shallow cracks.
A shrub or small tree up to 25 ft. high.
Living bark is dark green.
They sometimes curve slightly downward but are so horizontally placed on either side of the twig that it resembles a flat, large, bipinnate leaf.
There are five to seven, raised on the underside of leaves, lateral nerves on each side of the central nerve exists.
The seed with its pleated cotyledon germinates fairly quickly.
Very old bark is rough and peels off in thin irregular sections.
Fruits yellow, subglobose or ovoid, 1-1.2 cm.
Stamens included, anthers blackening, filaments 8-10 mm.
Flowers hermaphrodite, on pedicels up to 1 mm.
It has a thick persisting stalk.
The 17 to 21, sometimes up to 24 mm long and white petals are funnel-shaped fused with a 15 to 19, sometimes to 22 mm long corolla tube and 1.5 to 3.0 millimeters long and 10 to 13 mm wide.Corolla lobe.
When mature, it is drupaceous, golden-yellow and glossy, with a soft, thin skin.
The leaf undersides are hairy brown.
Leaflets are thin and smooth, up to 45 x 20 mm.
.The flowers are borne in broad, schirmrispigen inflorescences.
Asterid stubs.
The tree crown is far -charging.
Old stems are grey to dark grey and fairly smooth, the bark sporadically peeling off in thin longitudinal strips.
The leaf margin is notched smooth or only slightly.
Corolla white, funnel- shaped, spreading at the apex, 2-2.5 cm.
The flowers are borne in short sprays in the axils of the leaves.
The bald, top permanent ovary ovoid with a length of about 2 millimeters and a diameter of about 1.5 millimeters.
Leaves are 20-30 mm apart and arranged alternately along the twigs.
Negative correlations were obtained between seed width and temperature, seed width and rainfall, seed mass and temperature, and germination and temperature of the seed source.
Broad leaves strongly-nerved beneath.
The leathery sepals are fused together into a 7-9 mm long and wide at the opening 4-7 mm tube having three to five calyx teeth and sometimes splits into two cup lips.
The stamens are scheduled 3 to 5 mm from the base of the corolla.
The entire trunk is hollowed out.
They usually appear in September and October, together with the new leaves.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Adansonia digitata.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Leaves: Palmately compound and clustered at the ends of short, stocky branches.
The trunk is used to store water during dry periods It's not uncommon for old trees to have several huge trunks branching off near the ground, and a tree 20 tall can have a spread of more than 30 m. The stem is covered with a bark layer, which may be 50-100 mm thick.
A majestic, deciduous tree with a rounded or spreading crown and grey bark.
The leaves are palmately compound with 5 to 7 leaflets in mature trees, but seedlings and regenerating shoots may have simple leaves.
The fruit is unique in the family, consisting of a woody, indehiscent pericarp surrounding numerous, reniform seeds embedded in a chalky or spongy matrix.
The stem is covered with a bark layer, which may be 50-100 mm thick.
Leaves are alternate at the ends of branches or occur on short spurs on the trunk.
When they are young, baobabs do not resemble their adult counterparts, the stems are thin and inconspicuous, and their leaves are simple and not divided into the five to seven lobes of the adult trees.
The calyx is typically made up of 5 green triangular bent-back lobes with a cream-coloured, hairy interior.
Bark gray, smooth to irregularly tuberculate.
Leaves 5-7-foliolate, petioles pubescent or glabrous, stipules caducous, leaflets sessile to subsessile, varying greatly in size, medial leaflet 5-15 x 3-7 cm, usually elliptic-obovate, with acuminate apices and decurrent bases, glabrous or with simple or clumped hairs, margins entire.
Bisected flower.
It has a stout, grey trunk which is smooth and heavily folded.
The bark is gray and usually smooth.
Biology Plant Division  : Angiosperms Once it reaches around 30 or 40 years of age, the trunk begins to swell disproportionately to the size of its crown, often reaching 17 m in girth.
Size Chart Adansonia Digitata popularly known as the upside down tree, monkey bread tree, cream of tartar tree, lemonade tree can attain a height of upto 25 meters but the main stem of the baobab tree can reach a girth of up to 28 meters.
Styles are white, growing through the staminal tube and projecting beyond it.
They are usually bent at right-angles and topped with an irregular stigma.
Baobab is an indigenous fruit tree associated with the Savannah drylands of sub-Saharan Africa.
It splits open to disperse the seeds.
Seeds reniform, laterally flattened, 10-13 x 8-10 x 4-5 mm Germination phanerocotylar.
Adansonia digitate  can be recognized by its irregular, broad trunks and crowns and had a smooth, reddish-brown bark with large pendulous white flowers.
They are divided into 5-7 finger-like leaflets.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

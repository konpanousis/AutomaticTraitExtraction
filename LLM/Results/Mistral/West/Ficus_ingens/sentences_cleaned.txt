Ficus ingens.Introductie.
Subshrub on sunny slope.
Deciduous – Sheds Its Leaves Annually.
Ficus ingens is an evergreen tree with a briefly deciduous period, is up to 10 m, occasionally higher, with a rounded or spreading crown and with a spread of up to 30 m wide.
Variable in form and size, semi-deciduous, from a shrub in cold winter parts of its distribution range to a medium sized tree of up to 13 m in height, very large specimens do occur, like the legendary inhabited tree described by Robert Moffatt of Kuruman from a trip in 1829.
All the parts have milky latex which is visible when a leaf is broken.

Receptacles are not sessile in images, short pedunculate and pink in colour.
Tree up to 18 m. tall.
A leaf measures some 16.5 by 8.5 cm, with the base mostly square or cordate , sometimes broadly rounded, and the apex tapering to a blunt point.
They ripen first to a white and eventually a purple or yellowish-brown colour.
The Wonderboom is always a tree, and has elliptic-oblong leaves with a rounded bases, that are never bright red-brown.
All figs present a white to yellowish latex , some in copious quantities, the twig shows paired stipules -or circular scars if the stipules have fallen off, the lateral veins at the base of the leaf are steep, forming a tighter angle with the midrib than the other lateral veins, a feature referred to as "triveined".
The Natal fig has the base of the leaf narrowly tapered.
Leaves ovate, lateral veins ± 8.
The heart-shaped or lanceolate, dull green leaves are hairless and leathery, with conspicuous yellow veins running parallel from the midrib and loping along the margin with three distinct veins at the base, up to 165 mm long and 85 mm wide.

It is deciduous or semi-deciduous and may form a subshrub or shrub, or may form a rounded crown, upwards of 5 meters tall, in sheltered conditions.
Stalked fruit or small figs are borne in pairs or singly in the leaf axil or on bare stems below the leaves.
The Red-leaved fig is a fig species with an extensive range in the subtropical to dry tropical regions of Africa and southern Arabia.
This is an evergreen tree which is briefly deciduous and grows to 10 m, with a rounded or spreading crown and with a spread of up to 30 m wide.
Figs pedunculate, single or paired in the leaf axils, or on bare stems below the leaves, spherical to slightly pear-shaped, 10-13 mm in diameter, with or without pale warts, creamy green, purple when ripe.
Nearly half of fig species are gynodioecious, and therefore have some plants with inflorescences with long styled pistillate flowers, and other plants with staminate flowers mixed with short styled pistillate flowers.
Plant Type: Shrub.
The many small flowers are unseen unless the fig is cut open.
They are 0.9 to 1.2 cm in diameter and carried on very short stalks, just below or among the terminal cluster of leaves.
Leaf lamina ovate to elliptic, oblong or sometimes lanceolate, 5-20 x
Ovate or lanceolate, green with entire margin, apex tapering, base lobed, sometimes square, variable size around 12 cm by 5 cm, petiole 2 cm, distinctive and pronounced netveining, new leaves sprouting shortly after old leaves are lost, which happens rather briskly within a week or two, new leaves pink, coppery or bronze-red for about a week, living up to the common name before gradually turning green, leaves said to be toxic.
Fig plants can be monoecious or gynodioecious.
The Wonderboom is an evergreen fig species that ranges from the KwaZulu-Natal midlands northwards to tropical East Africa.
Figs in pairs in the leaf-axils or just below the leaves, subsessile or on peduncles up to 0.5 cm.
The stipule of Ficus religiosa.
Despite its specific name, which means "huge", or "vast", it is usually a shrub or tree of modest proportions.
Ficus ingens , the red-leaved fig , is a fig species with an extensive range in the subtropical to dry tropical regions of Africa and southern Arabia.
Ficus superba variation henneana Corner.
Small or medium-sized to large deciduous tree, terrestrial or as a rock splitter.

Ficus ingens and Eve Palmer . See more » Ficus Ficus is a genus of about 850 species of woody trees, shrubs, vines, epiphytes and hemiepiphytes in the family Moraceae.
Its figs are much smaller and mature to yellow-red.
Leaves ovate, lanceolate, to oblong-lanceolate, 5-17 cm long, mid- to dark green above, paler below, hairless, base mostly truncate or shallowly cordate, margins entire, flat or slightly wavy.
The white stipule contains a new leaf and a new stipule.
The heart-shaped or lanceolate, dull green leaves are hairless and leathery, with conspicuous yellow veins running parallel from the midrib.
The smooth bark is pale grey, while younger branches have a yellow tinge.
Morphology Tree up to 15 m. tall.
They are 0.9 to 1.2 cm in diameter and carried on very short stalks, just below or among the terminal cluster of leaves.
Pale yellow-green round figs of slightly more than 1 cm in diameter on stalks in leaf axils in profusion, turn purple or brown-red when they ripen over a prolonged season from winter and at least throughout summer.
Figs in pairs in the leaf axils or just below the leaves, subsessile or on peduncles up to 0.5 mm.
The fruit typically has a bulbous shape with a small opening at the outward end that allows access to pollinators.
Monoecious tree to 15 m, bark grey.
Old leaves turn to a reddish-copper colour in autumn.
Figs are white at first, becoming pink, red or purple when mature and are soft and fleshy.
Multi-branched, broad and convoluted trunks twining at its bulky base, light grey, smooth bark, the base usually hugging a rock, spreading and curving branches, if allowed by other vegetation to grow freely develops a rounded crown, but usually straggling among other bushes and trees.
All the parts have milky latex when broken.
The smooth and leathery, dull-green leaves are narrowly ovate oblong, bright red brown when young, with conspicuous yellow veins that are prominent beneath and loop along the leaf margin.
A leaf measures some 16.5 by 8.5 cm, with the base mostly square or cordate , sometimes broadly rounded, and the apex tapering to a blunt point.
The genus Dorstenia , also in the fig family , exhibits similar tiny flowers arranged on a receptacle but in this case the receptacle is a more or less flat, open surface.
The bark is grey, smooth and becomes cracked in older specimens.

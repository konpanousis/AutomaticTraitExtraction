Aeschynomene elaphroxylon , also known as an ambatch , pith-tree , balsa wood tree , or umburu , is a common large shrub to small tree of the genus Aeschynomene in the family Fabaceae growing in swamps, lakes and rivers in Tropical Africa.
The seeds are contained in flattened, erect pods that grow in contorted into twisted full or half spirals on the tree.
It grows two to nine, exceptionally up to twelve, metres high, with a straight, thick, swollen, conical trunk.
It has peltate stipules which have an erose appendage below the point of attachment, 2-4mm in diameter.
Pods spirally contorted, 10-14 cm.

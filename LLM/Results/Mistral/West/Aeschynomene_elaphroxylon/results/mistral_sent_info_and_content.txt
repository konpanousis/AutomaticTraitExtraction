We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Aeschynomene elaphroxylon.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
These bracteoles are ovate or elliptic, and asymmetrical, in shape, and covered in velvety hairs.
These stipules have a lobe on one side only, are velvety in texture, broadly ovate in shape with the upper portion deltoid-ovate and ending in an acute tip, are 10-13mm in length, 5-6mm in width, and eventually fall off as the leaf matures.
Aeschynomene elaphroxylon , also known as an ambatch , pith-tree , balsa wood tree , or umburu , is a common large shrub to small tree of the genus Aeschynomene in the family Fabaceae growing in swamps, lakes and rivers in Tropical Africa.
The seeds are contained in flattened, erect pods that grow in contorted into twisted full or half spirals on the tree.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

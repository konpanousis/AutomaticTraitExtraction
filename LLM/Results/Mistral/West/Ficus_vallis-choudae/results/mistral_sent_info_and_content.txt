We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Ficus vallis-choudae.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Figs solitary in leaf axils, up to 4 cm in diameter, densely velvety, turning yellow to orange when ripe, with faint reddish stripes.
Tree to 20 m tall, terrestrial.
Basal bracts 3, lateral bracts absent, several ostiolar bracts visible Like other species of Subgenus Sycomorus , the figs develop over an extended period, not all reaching maturity together, as they do in most Ficus spp.
Tree up to 10 m. tall.
Leaves simple, alternate, coriaceous, oval blades up to 20 x 22 cm, with smooth upper surface, petiole up to 8 cm long, stipules 1-3 cm long, deciduous.
Ficus vallis-choudae - Seeds A-Z, Seeds F.
Trees or shrubs terrestrial, monoecious.
Figs solitary in the leaf axils or just below the leaves, occasionally on leafless branchlets up to 30 cm.
The fruits are solitary figs in the axils of the leaves.
All figs present a white to yellowish latex , some in copious quantities, the twig shows paired stipules -Â”or circular scars if the stipules have fallen off, the lateral veins at the base of the leaf are steep, forming a tighter angle with the midrib than the other lateral veins, a feature referred to as "triveined".
The figs, up to 5 cm.
Description Shrub or small tree up to 8 m tall, with well developed, spreading crown and short stem, bark gray brown, slightly fissured and a little scaly, pink slice exuding a white latex scanty.
Figs solitary in the leaf- axils or just below the leaves, peduncle 0.2-1.2 cm.
Branchlets and leaves nearly glabrous.
Nearly half of fig species are gynodioecious, and therefore have some plants with inflorescences with long styled pistillate flowers, and other plants with staminate flowers mixed with short styled pistillate flowers.
Leaves ovate to broadly ovate, upper surface rough to the touch, thin-leathery with conspicuous cream-green venation.
The many small flowers are unseen unless the fig is cut open.
Moraceae - Ficus - Ficus vallis-choudae Delile.
Fig plants can be monoecious or gynodioecious.
The stipule of Ficus religiosa.
Ficus superba variation henneana Corner.
Solitary, axillary figs, globose, a little flattened at the apex, yellowish with a dozen reddish meridian stripes.
The white stipule contains a new leaf and a new stipule.
Figs large, solitary.
Tree up to 15 m. tall.
The fruit typically has a bulbous shape with a small opening at the outward end that allows access to pollinators.
Figs solitary or paired in the leaf axils, or 1-3 together on leafless branches on old wood, often on the trunk.
The genus Dorstenia , also in the fig family , exhibits similar tiny flowers arranged on a receptacle but in this case the receptacle is a more or less flat, open surface.
A tree, to 60 ft. high.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

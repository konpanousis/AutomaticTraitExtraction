It is large tree averaging 20 to 25 meters in height and 1 m in diameter.
The height of the tree is up to 30 meters, the bark is brown to blackish in color, fruits are green in color when young and on maturity converts into brown color.
Fruit The fruit is a pendulous indehiscent pod that can be 7-20 cm long and 1.5-3.0 cm wide.
Tamarind trees are large with broad spreading crowns and often grow forming a dense canopy that impedes light penetration and prevents the germination, growth and regeneration of native plants in the understory.
Cover with seed raising mix to a depth of the seed width.
The chromosome number reported for T. indica is 2 n =24, 26, 28.
Botany.Tamarindus is a monotypic genus within the Caesalpiniaceae subfamily of legumes.
The bark is strongly fissured and scaly grey on the stem and smooth on the branches.
Tamarindus Indica is long-lived, a beautiful fruiting tree growing up to the height of 30 meters.
The flower buds are often pink because of the outer colour of the four sepals that are shed as the flower opens.
The leaves are pinnate and 8-15 cm long, with 10-20 pairs of 1.25-2.5 cm long and 5-6 mm wide , narrowly oblong, unequal and entire, rounded to almost square and slightly notched at the apex with a tuft of yellow hairs and rounded at the base.
Leaves are alternate and paripinnate-each with 9 to 12 pairs of small leaflets.
Tamarindus indica is an evergreen, drought, deciduous, flowering, large perennial tree, with a wide-spreading dense symmetrical canopy and short stout.

The rachis is 7-15 cm long with six to 20 pairs of opposite leaflets.
Leaves The leaves are alternate, even and pari-pinnately compound.
Tecomella undulata.
Growth is generally slow, with seedling height increasing by about 60 cm annually.
A graceful ornamental tree with racemes of pea-like flowers and edible pods.
The pods are typically leguminous in appearance, oblong, straight or slightly curved, turning from green to dark brown as they ripen.
Tamarind trees are large, with broad spreading crowns and often grow forming a dense canopy that impedes sunlight penetration and prevents the germination, growth and regeneration of native plant species in the understory.
Mature fruit pods are cinnamon or dark brown and brittle.
Young seeds contain an amber, sweet-tasting oil.
The pod thickens as it matures and the green pulp surrounding the seeds turns reddish-brown or brown.

The tree is normally multi-stemmed, which sometimes results in a poor tree form.
Of the five petals, the posterior and lateral petals are large and showy and slightly exceed the calyx, oblong in shape.
Flowers emerge on the new shoots that mark the leaf change, but some trees flower later, even as late as February when the shoots have long matured.
The pods reach maturity about 7 months after fruit set, and are fully ripe and dry around 1 month later.
The flowers can be bisexual, as well as dichogamous and protogynous.
The peak of anthesis takes place at 06:00 h the next day, with peak anther dehiscence at 10:30 h. Flowers usually develop in the spring or summer, with synchronous leaf growth.
The anterior petals are reduced to bristles.
Flower Color:.
Tamarind is a long-lived, slow-growing and highly wind-resistant deciduous tree that can reach 20-30 m height with a canopy spread of 8-14 m in diameter.
The skin is cinnamon to greyish-brown and scaly, and normally has constrictions between the seeds.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Piliostigma thonningii.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The pods do not spilt but fall from the branches, then rot whilst on the ground, releasing the seeds.
It grows up to 5-10 m tall, with leaves that are similar to a bauhinia , but it differs from bauhinia by having separate male and female flowers on separate trees.
Flowers medium to small, unisexual in racemes or panicles, white or pinkish tinged.
Piliostigma Thonningii Piliostigma thonningii is a leguminous plant belonging to the sub family Caesalpiniacea , a family that comprises of trees, shrubs or very rarely scramblers.
The small white flowers are not showy.
Pubescent , dilaté aux deux extrémités, de 2,5-5 cm de long.
The heartwood is pinkish to dark brown, the sapwood pale brown.
Differs from similar species in Bauhinia by the unisexual flowers and the indehiscent pods.
It is dioecious , with male and female flowers on separate plants.
Piliostigma thonningii is a leguminous plant of sub-family Caesalpiniacea , comprising of trees, shrubs or very rarely scramblers.
Leaves alternate, conspicuously bi-lobed for one eighth to one third of the length, stipules 3-6 mm long, deciduous, petiole 2-5 cm long, pubescent, blade up to 17 cm x 21 cm, base usually strongly cordate, apex of lobes rounded to acute, leathery, upper surface glabrous, lower surface with rusty-brown crisped hairs and conspicuous reticulate venation, palmately veined with 11-15 basal veins.
Inflorescence a panicle, usually alternately leaf-opposed and axillary along branches, male inflorescence very narrowly pyramidal, up to 25 cm x 5.5 cm, female inflorescence up to 7 cm long, few-flowered, axes brown-tomentellous.
Tiny white flowers during Summer.
Small tree, heavily fruiting.
Piliostigma thonningii showing leaves, pods and seeds 3.7.
Pubescent ferrugineux, gris-brun.
The root yields a red-brown or black dye, and the fruit and seeds a black or blue one.
Flowers are followed by large, thick, reddish brown, non-splitting pods about 30-70 mm long.
Approximately 25 seeds per packet.
Large leathery 2-lobed leaves.
Fruit an oblong to linear-oblong pod 12-30 cm x 3-7 cm, woody, brown-pubescent when young but later glabrescent, persisting on the tree but finally decaying on the ground, many-seeded.
The fruits, which are hairy, hard, flattish, rusty brown and woody splits at ripening and usually persistent on the tree, are produced between June and September.
A conspicuous feature of the tree is its large, simple, two-lobed, leathery leaves which resemble a camel's foot and account for the common name.
Piliostigma thonningii is a deciduous tree with a single stem.
Flowers unisexual, fragrant, calyx cupular, 1-2.5 cm long, 5-lobed, brown-tomentellous, petals 5, obovate, 1-2.5 cm long, wrinkled, margin strongly undulate, white to lilac or pink, stamens 10, scarcely reaching the throat of the flower, reduced to staminodes in female flowers, ovary brown-tomentose, rudimentary in male flowers, style very short or absent, stigma capitate.

Image notes: Small tree, heavily fruiting.
Description     Deciduous, dioecious tree up to 10 m tall, sometimes shrubby, bole branchless for 2-3 m, twisted, up to 30 cm in diameter, outer bark rough, longitudinally fissured, dark brown to grey or black, inner bark fibrous, pink to dark red-brown when cut, crown spreading, branches with rusty-brown tomentum, somewhat glabrescent later.
A 3-10m high medicinal tree.
The flower petals are white and the thick, calyces are covered in rust coloured hairs.
The bark is dark brownish grey with a rough surface.
Seeds usually germinate 5-10 days after sowing.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

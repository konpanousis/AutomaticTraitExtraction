Inflorescence a panicle, usually alternately leaf-opposed and axillary along branches, male inflorescence very narrowly pyramidal, up to 25 cm x 5.5 cm, female inflorescence up to 7 cm long, few-flowered, axes brown-tomentellous.

Piliostigma thonningii showing leaves, pods and seeds 3.7.
Pubescent ferrugineux, gris-brun.
The root yields a red-brown or black dye, and the fruit and seeds a black or blue one.
Flowers are followed by large, thick, reddish brown, non-splitting pods about 30-70 mm long.

Large leathery 2-lobed leaves.
Fruit an oblong to linear-oblong pod 12-30 cm x 3-7 cm, woody, brown-pubescent when young but later glabrescent, persisting on the tree but finally decaying on the ground, many-seeded.
The fruits, which are hairy, hard, flattish, rusty brown and woody splits at ripening and usually persistent on the tree, are produced between June and September.
A conspicuous feature of the tree is its large, simple, two-lobed, leathery leaves which resemble a camel's foot and account for the common name.

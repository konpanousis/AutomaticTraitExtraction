We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Afzelia africana.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

In autumn they split open to release distinctively black seeds with scarlet arils.
Members are characterized by alternate paripinnate leaves with usually opposite leaflets.
Axial parenchyma: 80: axial parenchyma aliform, 81: axial parenchyma lozenge-aliform, 83: axial parenchyma confluent, 89: axial parenchyma in marginal or in seemingly marginal bands, 91: two cells per parenchyma strand, 92: four cells per parenchyma strand.
Seeds buried for 2 cm with the hilum facing downward showed the best results, whereas seeds buried for 6 cm germinated but decayed.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

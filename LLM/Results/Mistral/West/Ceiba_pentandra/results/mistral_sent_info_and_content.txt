We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Ceiba pentandra.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Creamy white to pink.
Fruits are ellipsoid woody capsules each of which contains up to 200 tiny seeds embedded in cotton-like kapok.
Exceptional specimens may reach heights of up to 40 m , though it is more commonly a medium-sized tree 15 to 25 m tall.
Dehisced fruit having shed shrivelled valves.
At maturity, the shell splits into five longitudinal sections, exposing a mass of wholly creamy-white hairs, inside of which are up to a hundred small roundish black seed.
The leaves are palmately compound, made up of five to seven dark green leaflets in a close arrangement, casting a deep shade.
Field tips Stem prickly when young, later smooth, green.
Palmate compound leaves have 5-9 leaflets with all leaflets extending outward from a single point at the base of the leaf.
The palmate leaves are composed of 5 to 9 leaflets, each up to 20 cm long.
Licenses - CC_BY References - Trees, to 20 m high, buttressed at base, bark green or greenish-grey, peeling off in round bosses, exudation red, watery, sticky, branches horizontal in whorls.
Flowers bisexual, creamy white, usually in clusters of 3-10, axillary or grouped towards the ends of leafless branchlets, rarely solitary, axillary, pedicels 2-4 cm long, stout, glabrous, calyx green, campanulate, ca.
Trunk diameter on average size trees will reach 6- at maturity, but may extend to as much as 9- or more on large trees.
Leaves digitately compound, alternate, gathered towards the apex of branchlets, rachis 5-20 cm, slender, glabrous, swollen tip and base, leaflets 5-9, petiolule 3-8 mm, stout, glabrous, lamina 4.5-14.5 x 1.5-4 cm, elliptic, obovate-oblong or ovate-oblong, base acute or cuneate, apex acute or acuminate, margin entire, glabrous, chartaceous, lateral nerves 5-14 pairs, pinnate, prominent, intercostae reticulate, prominent.
Fertilised flowers develop into oval fruit 10 to 20 cm long, green when young, becoming dark brown when mature and with a weak shell that can be crushed by hand.
Fruit An ellipsoid to fusiform capsule, indehiscent, valves with silky fibres, seeds numerous, subglobose, enveloped in silky cotton.
The wood is whitish, pale brown, or pinkish brown, often with yellowish or grayish streaks.
Flowers have bell-shaped calyces with five shallow lobes, five pubescent, oblong to spatulate petals, and 5 stamens fused into a tube.
Underside of single leaf.
Massive, straight, often spiny trunks on mature trees have wide spreading buttresses at the base.
Fruit close-up.
Capsules split open when ripe to release the silky seeds which are easily distributed by wind.
On well-shaped trees, the trunk is tall, straight, round and bulbous, with prominent buttresses near the ground and an umbrella-shaped crown at the top, formed by far-stretching, horizontal branches.
Depending on the growing conditions, the trunk may be clear of branches for most of the tree's height or is low-branching.
The bark is grey and smooth except for stout pyramidal spines on young trees, these becoming absent on mature trees.
It is a deciduous tree that belongs to the mallow family.
The trees produce several hundred 15 cm pods containing seeds surrounded by a fluffy, yellowish fibre that is a mix of lignin and cellulose.

Ceiba is a large tree, which grows to 66 m in height with a straight cylindrical bole 13 to 20 m long.
These major branches, usually 4 to 6 in number, can be up to 1.8 m thick and form a crown of foliage as much as 61 m in width.
Ceiba pentandra , commonly known as kapok or silk-cotton tree, is a fast-growing , deciduous tropical tree of the Bombax family that typically matures to 75-125-, but infrequently soars to as much as 230- tall with a broad-spreading, somewhat flattened crown consisting of nearly horizontal branching.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

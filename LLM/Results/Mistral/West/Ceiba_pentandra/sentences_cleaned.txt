Fruit close-up.
Capsules split open when ripe to release the silky seeds which are easily distributed by wind.
On well-shaped trees, the trunk is tall, straight, round and bulbous, with prominent buttresses near the ground and an umbrella-shaped crown at the top, formed by far-stretching, horizontal branches.
Depending on the growing conditions, the trunk may be clear of branches for most of the tree's height or is low-branching.
The bark is grey and smooth except for stout pyramidal spines on young trees, these becoming absent on mature trees.
It is a deciduous tree that belongs to the mallow family.
The trees produce several hundred 15 cm pods containing seeds surrounded by a fluffy, yellowish fibre that is a mix of lignin and cellulose.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Bombax costatum.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Leaflets are partly ovate, and acuminate at both ends, with 8-10 pairs of lateral nerves.
Bombax costatum is a tree usually reaching a height of 5 - 15 m. It flowers in the dry season before the leaves appear.
Fallen flower of Bombax ceiba.
The cup-shaped calyx is fleshy.
The bright red, orange or yellow petals are fused at their basal.

The leaf blade is fingered palmate.
Fruits / graines.
The five to eight leaves are short- stalked and entire, with eight to ten pairs of lateral nerves.
Seeds are globose to pear-shaped, 4-5 mm in diameter, dark brown to black, embedded in the white floss.
The relatively slim, tall trunk is protected by a thick, korkige, gray -brown bark with corked spines.
.The alternate standing on the branches, 8-15 cm long leaves are divided into a long petiole and leaf blade one.

They measure 30 to 50 cm across and are palmate in shape with five to nine leaflets.
Bombax costatum is a deciduous tree that grows between 10 and 25 m height in relatively wet conditions , but hardly reaches over 6 m in the Sahel.
They bear five to ten cm long red flowers between January and March while the tree is still leafless.
The crown structure of young trees is storeyed, becoming irregular and sturdy in older trees.
Flowers have 6 bright red-orange petals.
.The 6 to 16 inches long, dark brown, ellipsoidal with a diameter of 3 to 6 inches fruit capsule opens at five longitudinal slots and dismisses some small seeds with their characteristic white seed hairs.
With a straight bole, it can reach 60 cm in diameter, and is sometimes buttressed.
The flower has a double perianth , a length of 5 to 6 centimeters and a diameter of 4-7 inches.
.The solitary on long, smooth flower stems flowers appear before the leaves.
Bombax costatum -Â” Wikipedia.
Bombax species are among the largest trees in their regions, reaching 30 to 40 metres in height and up to three metres in trunk diameter.
The stamens are present in bundles in two whorls, while the staminal column lacks lobes.
Flowers are 5-6 cm long and solitary, deep red, orange or yellow, tulip shaped, on long, glabrous peduncles with the calyx cup-shaped.
The leaves are compound with entire margins and are deciduous , being shed in the dry-season.
Bombax insigne.
The bark is thick, grey brown and corky, with typical conical, stout, sharp-pointed spines on the stem and branch, and with a light red brown slash.
Bombax costatum.
The fruit contains white floss, called kapok and several small seeds.
The fruit, an ellipsoidal capsule, is dark brown to brown, and composed of 5 valves, dehiscent, 8-16 cm long and 3-6 cm wide, of variable shape.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Raphia sudanica.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The seeds are considerably smaller than that of other Raphia.
The stiffly erect leaves can reach a length of 10 m or so and hold numerous leaflets that are blue green above and a beautiful whitish waxy below.
The Short Spadix Is Almost As Broad As Long, And The Branches Bear Crowded Spikes.
In Length, With 10-12 Stamens, The Filaments United For Most Of Their Length.
A trunkless, or near trunkless, palm with huge fronds.
Long, And Scales In 10 Rows.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

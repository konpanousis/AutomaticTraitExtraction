We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Ficus natalensis.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Variegated Ficus, Triangularis natalensis, Std., 1 g pot.
Leaves alternate or subopposite, lamina 3-9 x 1-4 cm, coriaceous, often obovate but sometimes elliptic or oblong-elliptic, dark green above, paler beneath, glabrous, apex rounded to acute or shortly acuminate, base cuneate, petiole 7 - 30 mm long.
It has aerial roots that, in time, thicken and grow together, developing into a large, buttressed trunk.
Leafy twigs 2-5 mm thick, glabrous or sparsely minutely puberulous, periderm not flaking off.
Decals en skins.
All figs present a white to yellowish latex , some in copious quantities, the twig shows paired stipules -or circular scars if the stipules have fallen off, the lateral veins at the base of the leaf are steep, forming a tighter angle with the midrib than the other lateral veins, a feature referred to as "triveined".

Decals & Skins.
Nearly half of fig species are gynodioecious, and therefore have some plants with inflorescences with long styled pistillate flowers, and other plants with staminate flowers mixed with short styled pistillate flowers.
The many small flowers are unseen unless the fig is cut open.
Mature Ficus natalensis - air roots.
Fruit axillary, 10-20 mm in diameter, glabrous , spherical or pear-shaped, becoming pink or bright red when ripe, ostiole flat or faintly raised , basal disk
Bark is grey, sometimes mottled, smooth with fine longitudinal cracks.
The bark is light gray and smooth.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

The leaves grew up from the culms sheath and gave rise to the leaf blade.
Branches develop from the upper nodes from about the fifth week of active stem growth.
Spikelets sessile, narrowly lanceolate, 1.5-4.5 cm long, pungent, 1-4-flowered with upper floret bisexual and lower florets male or sterile, lower glume 5-8 mm long, upper glume 8-10 mm long, lemma narrowly lanceolate, the lowest 12-20 mm long, the uppermost about as long as spikelet, tapering into a rigid spine up to 7 mm long, palea narrowly lanceolate, somewhat shorter than lemma, floret with 6 stamens, filaments united into a tube, and a glabrous ovary extending into a hollow style terminating in 3 stigmas.
Seedling with a short mesocotyl and a loose coleoptile, the first leaves without lamina, primary root a pale taproot bearing short lateral roots.
Fruit a spindle-shaped caryopsis 10-15 mm long.
It is a solid woody clump forming Bamboo growing up to a height of 3-13m and a diameter of 5-10cm.
They produced a length of 15.7 and 17.7cm for winter respectively.
Spikelet clusters 4-8 cm in diameter,spherical, ± confluent, spiny, bracts to 4 mm, ovate.

Shoot length of the cuttings taken in summer which reach 22cm and those taken in winter reach 32 cm, which is significantly different at P< 0.05.
Description     Clump-forming bamboo with a robust rhizome up to 10 cm in diameter, clump dense, typically consisting of 20-100 stems, stems erect, ascending or leaning outwards, 5-10 m tall and 3-8 cm in diameter, internodes 15-30 cm long, the basal ones solid, the distal ones thick-walled, glabrous at maturity, young shoots grey-green, densely silky hairy.
Stems reach 1.2 cm in diameter and 1.8-3.0 m in height within a few years of germination, reaching full height and diameter in 4-8 years.
Most of the seedlings developed 2-9 culms per clump.
New culms usually have active buds whereas old culms usually carry dormant buds.
The leaf blade is attached to the culm sheath with a very small petiole.
Culm sheaths were developed on each culm node during the growth of seedlings and tightly overlapped and surrounded the culm internodes.
The fruit is dispersed as a larger propagule including several glumes, it is dislodged by animals and adheres to fur.
Bamboos are perennial woody grasses that are fast growing and capable of producing utilizable annual production, which is not normally the case with other forest tree species.
Leaves alternate, simple, sheath up to 15 cm long, with 2-5 mm long bristles at top, ligule short, c. 0.5 mm long, blade linear-lanceolate to oblong, 5-20 cm x 1-5 cm, base tapering into a short false petiole, apex long-acuminate and pungent, somewhat glaucous, with numerous longitudinal veins.
Woody perennial, growing in dense clumps.
These branches were attached in alternate positions on the culm node.
The species is categorized to tall grass with woody culms and a height of 13m , unusual for a solid stem with a diameter of up to 10cm at the base.
Clump diameters range from 1 m to 8 m, and clumps may contain 20-100 stems.
Shrub over 2 m.
New shoots appear at the peripheries of clumps.
Spikelets 15-40 mm, very narrowly lanceolate, 1 upper florets bisexual, the rest reduced to lemmas, glumes ovate to oblong, lower 5-8 mm, lemmas narrowly lanceolate, the lowest 12-20 mm, ± hispid on the back, tipped with a rigid spine to 7 mm.

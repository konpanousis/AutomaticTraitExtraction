Female flowers: pedicels 1 mm.
Fruits borne on a stipe 2 mm long, flat, 2-3.5 x 2.3-4 cm, V-shaped, with 2 apical divergent rounded-rhomboid membranous striate wings, rounded or cordate at the base, reticulate, glabrous or pubescent, gland-dotted or not, somewhat shiny, yellow-green at first, turning pink then reddish-brown, dehiscent into 2 subtrapeziform cocci leaving a compressed-fusiform columella.
Male inflorescence a dense axillary spike up to 7 cm long, solitary or fascicled, female inflorescence a terminal few-flowered raceme up to 3 cm long, usually several together, or flowers solitary.
Male flowers are reddish to yellow in color, and appears in axillary clusters of spikes up to 9 cm long.
Seeds compressed circular, c. 10 mm x 5 mm, smooth, shiny, dark purplish brown, streaked with black.
A savannah shrub or small tree about 20 ft. high.
Petioles 0.2-1.6 cm long.
Male flowers: calyx 1 mm.
Hymenocardia mollis variation glabra Pax.
Description     Dioecious, deciduous shrub or small tree up to 6 m tall, often straggling, bole up to 30 cm in diameter, often stunted or contorted, bark smooth, pale brown or grey, flaking off, showing a powdery reddish to orange inner bark, upper branches spreading, lower branches drooping, young shoots short-hairy.
Species in this genus are dioecious , with male and female flowers on separate plants.
Female flowers axillary or solitary, or in few-flowered racemes up to 3 cm long terminating lateral leafy shoots, axis and bracts ± as in the male.
Seeds 1 x 0.5 cm, compressed-semicircular, smooth, shiny, dark purplish-brown streaked with black.
Female flowers:pedicels 1 mm.
Branchlets becoming rusty-powdery when the bark peels off.
Stipules 1-3 mm long, linear-lanceolate to filiform, pubescent, soon falling.
Seeds ± semicircular, compressed, 1 cm.
The wood is pale brown or pink, darkening to orange, hard, with fine texture and conspicuous annual rings.
The bitter stem bark is slightly astringent and causes copious salivation when chewed.
Male flowers: buds open, deep reddish-carmine or brownish, calyx 1.5-2 mm across, shallowly 5-lobed, the lobes obtuse, ciliate, pinkish, anthers 1.2 mm long, dorsally purplish-tinged, pollen pale yellow, pistillode 2-lobed, 1 mm high.
A shrub or small tree up to 10 m high, often straggling or untidy, crown flat or rounded, upper branches spreading, lower branches drooping, bole 15-30 cm in diameter at breast height, often stunted or contorted, bark smooth, light brown or grey, flaking off to leave a powdery rufous or fulvous underbark.
Stem: stunted or contorted, characteristic rough rusty-red bark, to 30cm in diameter, wood is light brown or pink, darkening to orange, close-grained, with conspicuous annual rings, hard, brittle, dense, durable, good resistance to termite-attack.
The leaves are alternate, simple in arrangement with stipules that are up to 3 mm long, leaf-blade is elliptic to oblong in outline up to 9.5 cm long and 5 cm wide, and a coriaceous surface with golden to orange scales beneath.
Leaf-blades oblong, oblanceolate-oblong or obovate-oblong, rarely ± ovate, 5-7 cm.

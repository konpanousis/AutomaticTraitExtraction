We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Agave sisalana.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Inflorescence: 5-6 m tall, `paniculate', ellipsoid, scape short, part-inflorescences 10-15 in the upper half of the inflorescence, bulbilliferous after flowering.
The terminal spines are removed before or after the leaves have been cut.
Agave amaniensis is a diploid, with sword-shaped leaves c. 165 cm long, very glaucous blue, thick at the base and tipped with a reddish brown spine.
The flower stalk subdivides to form branches that bear the flowers.
Flowers for the most part are a rather undistinguished "lily"-type.
Style exserted, stigma 3-lobed.
Perianths with 6 segments, 6 stamens, filaments longer than the perianth segment, 3-4 cm long anthers.
The angle between unfurling leaves and stem gradually widens until the lower leaves are almost horizontal.
Leaves are arranged in an ascending spiral.
Before flowering, a flower stalk of 4.5-6.0 m develops from the growth point.
Flowers are yellowish green, with reddish filaments.
Come altre succulente di poche pretese, la pianta richiede piccole cure.
When the plant is not flowering, the stem is short and thick, 0.4 - 1 metres tall.
Leaves succulent, arranged in an ascending spiral, stipules absent, petiole absent, blade linear-lanceolate, 75-185 cm x 10-15 cm x 2-4.5 cm, base fleshy, bulbous, triangular in cross section, blade gradually broadening to the middle and narrowing into a terminal sharp, lignified, dark brown spine up to 3 cm long, concave above and convex below, margin usually spineless, surface dark green but covered with a white waxy layer.
Bulbils are normally formed on the panicle after the flowers are shed and usually appear in the bottom branches of the pole before the upper flowers have finished flowering.
Terminal spine very sharp, subulate, shortly shallowly grooved above, 2-2.5 cm long, dark brown, somewhat lustrous, not decurrent.
Description Agave sisalana is a woody herb with a rosette of thick fleshy spiny leaves that are shaped like a sword, measuring up to 2 metres long.
It is easily recognizable by its unarmed mature leaves ending with a short dark brown terminal spine.
Flowering starts on the lowest branch and proceeds upwards, taking several weeks until all branches have flowered.
Ovary shortly fusiform, 20-25 mm, nearly neckless.

In the central bud immature white leaves are packed tightly around the meristem until they are pushed outwards by the growth of succeeding leaves and unfurl.
A branched inflorescence forms atop an up to 30 feet tall flower stalk with yellowish-green flowers.
Young leaves may have a few minute teeth along their margins, but lose them as they mature.
Young leaves with few minute marginal teeth, mature leaves usually without marginal teeth.
The stamens dehisce 2-3 days before the style is fully elongated and the stigma is sticky and receptive.
The 2-4 mm thick root arises from leaf scars at the base of the bole beneath the soil surface, and extends up to 5 m horizontally way from the mother plant, forming suckers.
Leaf edges are spiny with a sharp, dark brown tip.
Description     Robust, monocarpic, perennial herb, 3-9 m tall when flowering, with numerous leaves crowded in a dense rosette, roots fibrous, originating from the base of the leaf scars at the bottom of the stem, spreading horizontally up to 3 m, and vertically up to 150 cm, but concentrated in the upper 30-40 cm of the soil, stem short and thick, 120 cm x 20 cm, with an apical meristem, rhizomes arising from buds in the axils of leaves below ground level, numbering 5-10 at one time and about 20 in the total life span, 1.5-3 cm in diameter, growing to about 2 m in length before surfacing and producing suckers.
Tepals greenish-yellow, tube broadly urceolate, 15-18 mm, lobes equal, 17-18 mm.
Description: The Sisal, Agave sisalana , is a a monocarpic, perennial, short stemmed or stemless succulent herb with dark green leaves in rosettes and inflorescence in panicles.
Leaves may live for 5 years and still be photosynthetically active.
When sisal becomes reproductive, new leaves progressively become shorter.
At maturity, flower stalks rise 15 to 20 feet tall.
During the initial vegetative phase of the sisal plant each new leaf is 0.6-0.8 cm longer than the preceding leaf.

Inflorescence a panicle on a long peduncle, 2-8 m tall, branches widely spreading, 30-100 cm x 2 cm, apically 5-6 times branched trichotomously, bearing about 40 flowers per branch.
Bulbils copiously produced on the inflorescence branches, consisting of a meristem, 6-8 reduced leaves and a rudimentary stem with rudimentary adventitious roots.
Older plants can have a short stem and occasionally a leaf might display a yellow stripe.
It grows up to 6 feet tall.
White, fleshy stems develop from underground buds at the base of the plant, first growing sideways and then upwards to form new plants.
Leaves are grey-green with a sharp dark brown spine at the end.
Young leaves may have small spines along their margins, they disappear when the plant matures.

Leaves are usually cut manually at 2.5-5 cm from the bole.
Trunk.The plant base is a short trunk , from the top of which the spirally arranged leaves grow.

Moreover Sisal produces subterraneous rhizomes from buds in the axils of the lower leaves.
The cross-section at the base of the leaf resembles a flattened triangle.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Thevetia neriifolia.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
It is long funnel shaped sometimes fragrant yellow in color.
Its leaves are willow – like, linear, lanceolate & glossy green in color.
The most important xeromorphic characters in the leaves are thick and cutinized outer cell walls of the upper epidermis, a thick and in A. nerüfolia highly sculptured cuticle and in V, minor a two–layered palisade chlorenchyma and fiber bundles in the veins.
Flowers: The sweetly perfumed flowers are funnel-shaped, bright yellow or peach colored, 5.5–7cm long and 2.5–4cm wide, grouped in clusters at the end of the branches.
The plant usually has several major stems.
Each fruit  contains a nut which is longitudinally and transversely divided.
The flowers are funnel-shaped, 3 inches long, and have 5 overlapping petals that open in a spiraled pinwheel.
The broken foliage oozes toxic white latex sap.
The fruits are somewhat globular ,  slightly fleshy and have a diameter of 4-5 cm.
Thevetia neriifolia is an evergreen tropical shrub having glossy dark green leaves.
The fruit is a drupe.
Its fruit is deep red –black in color.
The fruit is fleshy and soft like a plum and encloses a “stone” comprising two starchy kernels.
Flowers are bright yellow and funnel-shaped  with 5 petals spirally twisted.
A large spreading shrub usually 2.5–3.5m tall.
Its stem is green turning silver/grey.
The leaves are glossy green, strap-like, alternating on the stem, 5.5–15cm long and 0.5–1.5cm wide.
Duration: Perennial, Evergreen.
Fruit/Berries: The fruit are angular, green when immature, ripening black, broader than long and somewhat triangular in outline, with a raised ridge around the middle, about 3–4.5cm in diameter.
The flowers are funnel-shaped, fragrant and yellow colored.
The fruits,  which are green in colour, become black on ripening.
The flowers are followed by 1 1/2 inch in diameter, angled, semi-rhomboid, green ripening to brown or black fruits that usually contain two seeds.
Flowers bloom from summer to fall.
Its flowers are 3 inches long, have 5 overlapping petals that open in a spiraled pin wheeled.
The leaves are glossy green above, pale green below, leathery, hairless, spirally arranged, and linear-lanceolate in shape.
The leaves are spirally arranged, linear and about 13-15 cm in length.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

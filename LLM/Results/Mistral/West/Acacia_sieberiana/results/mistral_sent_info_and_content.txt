We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Acacia sieberiana.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The flaky, papery bark peels off in flattish strips, revealing a yellow underbark.
Flowers white, or pale yellow, fragrant.
.Acacia is a genus of flowering tropical and subtropical trees and shrubs.
Grey brown pods, containing seeds, follow in autumn and ripen on the tree.
Growth Habit - N/A.
Pod 8-21 cm long, c. 1.5-3.5 cm broad, straight or slightly curved, indehiscent.
The branches are round, soft and bent ones.
It also bears pods which are 3-6 inch long, each pod has 8-12 flat seeds.
The paired thorns of this Acacia are strong, straight and coloured white.
Deciduous – Sheds Its Leaves Annually.
Pinnae 6-35 pairs, leaflets 15-52 pairs.
They are clothed in fine, feathery, twice-compound leaves of rich green that contrast strikingly with their light brown to grey-yellow cork bark.
Seeds olive-grey, 9-12 x 7-8 mm., smooth, elliptic to subcircular, compressed areole 7-9.5 x 5-6 mm.
The flowers are round, yellow and grow in bunches of 4-6.
The individual flowers of Acacia species are small but usually occur in dense, globular heads or elongated spikes.
The Paperbark sometimes produce paired, white thorns which are joined at the base and grow to a length of 100mm.
Scented, creamy-white, ball-shaped flowers arrive in profusion during spring , followed by smooth, woody seed pods that shed in the autumn.
Tree 5-18 m. high, bark usually grey and rough on trunk, sometimes light brown, or yellowish and flaking especially on branches.
This beautifully shaped tree can grow to a height of 8 to 15 m and has fine, feathery, deep green foliage.
Morphology Seeds olive-grey, smooth, elliptic to subcircular, compressed, 9-12 mm.
Paired thorns are long, strong, straight and white.
The creamy-white, spherical flower heads.
Acacia sieberiana is a perennial tree native to Africa and introduced into Pakistan.
Flowers white or very pale yellow, in heads on axillary peduncles 1.5-5 cm.
The tree varies from 3 to 25 m in height, with a trunk diameter of 0.6 to 1.8 m. It is not listed as being a threatened species.
The yellow flower heads are about 0.25 inch in diameter.
The species known as false acacia is distinguished by its flowers that are scented, generally white in color, and hang in loose clusters.
Light brown, woody pods are formed from autumn onwards, are cylindrical and thickened.
The bark often flakes off in papery strips, a characteristic that gave rise to the tree’s common name.
Leafstalks in this species are about 1 inch long and 0.25 inch wide.
Flowers white or very pale yellow, in heads on axillary peduncles 1.5-5 cm.
Stipules spinescent, white, straight, strong, up to 12.5 cm long, ant galls absent.
Pods straight or sometimes ± falcate, flattened but thick and almost woody in texture when dry, very slow in dehiscing, 9-21 cm.
Conspicuous white thorns up to 9 cm long are held in pairs on some specimens and yet are absent on others.
Acacia is a genus of many trees and shrubs that belong to the family of Fabaceae.
The new tender branches are slippery and oily.
During spring, balls of cream to yellow coloured flowers appear in profusion and it has a sweet scent that attracts insects and birds alike.
They are relatively quick growing, and can reach a height of 17 metres, with an equally wide, flattish spread in ideal conditions.
The plants of these genus show characteristics like pod bearing with sap, leaves typically bearing large amount of tannins, and having thorns.
Sharp, Hollow Thorns Many acacia species produce pairs of sharp, hollow thorns on the leaves and stems.
Balls of creamy to pale yellow scented flowers are borne in spring to summer and entice insects.

Leaves: rhachis 2.5-10 cm.
Previously known as the Acacia sieberiana, the indigenous Paperbark tree is easily identified by its flattened crown with dense, spreading foliage and papery bark.
General Information A large sized tree, crown flat or umbrella-like.
It bears leaves which are bipinnate, very small and in a group of 4-9 leaves.
However, the pea-shaped blossoms of the Robinia are generally white in color, and can be observed as small, multiple stamened, yellow, bottle brush-like flowers to the true acacia tree, hence the white acacia.
Stipules spinescent, whitish, up to 9 cm.
The flowers are characteristically yellow, although sometimes white, and typically have five sepals and petals, many stamens, and a single pistil.
This tree is Semi-deciduous with ball-shaped, creamy-white flowers in spring.
Tree 5-18 m. high, bark usually grey and rough on the trunk, sometimes light-brown, or yellowish and flaking, especially on the branches, young branchlets glabrous to tomentose, eglandular, green to grey or yellowish, later grey, outer bark then usually flaking away to expose an olive or yellow inner layer.
The bark of the tree is brown in color, dry and form cracks in length.
The tree is characterised by low branching and its branches experience successive death of branch tips followed by the development of one or more secondary branches emanating in different directions from the previous death point.
.The leaves of acacias are either pinnate or reduced to a leafstalk with no blades.
Forms papery textured, light cream brown coloured bark.
Though this tree grows quickly, it is short-lived.
Pods very slow in dehiscing, 9-21 x 1.7-3.5 cm.
Stipules spinescent, straight, up to 9 cm.
No Botanical name Family 1 Acacia sieberiana DC.
The fruit of this tree are light brown, woody pods following the flowers they are produced from autumn onwards, they are shaped cylindrical are thickened and often bear velvety hairs.
Galinsoga parviflora Cav.* Asteraceae 24
This plant bears deep green, feathery foliage.
Young branchlets glabrous to tomentose, eglandular, green to grey or yellowish, later grey, outer bark then usually flaking away to expose an olive or yellow inner layer.
Pacific forms, the leafstalk and leaf axis are flat vertically, the leaflets are partially or completely absent, and the basal portion of the leafstalk develops into thorns.
A magnificent, widely spreading, flat crown of deep green, feathery foliage and attractive creamy-tan to yellow-brown corky bark, make this an easy tree to identify.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

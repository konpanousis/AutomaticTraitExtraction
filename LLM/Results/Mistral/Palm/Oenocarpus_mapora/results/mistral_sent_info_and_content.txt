We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Oenocarpus mapora.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Inflorescence once branched, with a short rachis, and numerous pendulous, to 70 cm long branches.
Stems clustered, often numerous, to 15 m tall and 10-20 cm in diameter.
Whitish trunks up to 6 inches in diameter.
It is single stemmed and quite delicate.
Spacing: 15-20 ft. 20-30 ft.
Grows in stands up to 50' and has whitish trunks with dark crownshafts.
An attractive, medium to large clumpiung palm to 20m tall, with up to 12 stems.
Rank: SEEDLING.
Rank: FLOWERING.
The fruits had a length, width and weight of 18.9 ± 1.0 mm, 17.8 ± 0.9 mm and 3.9 ± 0.5 g, respectively.
The fruits are ovoid, 1-2 cm long, dark purple when ripe, and contain one seed only.
Fruits elongate or ovoid, purple when ripe, pointed at apex, 2-3 cm long.

Pendant medium to dark green leaflets.
The inflorescences come out under the leaves, red when in fruit, like a “ponytail”, formed by a short main axis from which depart even 100 floriferous branches, up to about 40 cm long, pendulous, with white unisexual flowers united in the characteristic triad in the part close to the rachis, and only male flowers in the terminal part.
O. mapora looking into the crown.
The leaves are pinnate, 2-3 m long, with 40-80 pinnulae per side, long up to about 80 cm and 4-5 cm broad, acuminate, of intense green colour on the upper side, blue-green below, regularly disposed but the centre where they are grouped in number of 2 to 5, the foliar base, olive green or dark purple, does not wrap completely the stem, the leaves, at their opening, are of bronze colour.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Areca laosensis.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Stem c. 1.5-2.5 cm diam.
Minute to large, solitary or clustered, unarmed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms, almost always with a well-defined crownshaft.
The betel-nut palm and its relatives, acaulescent, or erect, diminutive or robust palms of Southeast Asia to West Pacific, with crownshafts, with entire or lobed leaflet tips and a single large bract in the inflorescence, the pistillate flowers borne only at the rachilla bases and with basal hilum on the seed.
It grows a thin, ringed, smooth reddish trunk , to about 5 m tall, a spread of 2 m, with a green crownshaft, topped by a small crown of sparsely pinnate leaves, inflorescence is a pinkish-yellow.
Fruit: 1-3.5 cm.
Fruit globose, ovoid, or spindle-shaped, often brightly coloured, rarely dull brown or green, stigmatic remains apical, epicarp smooth, shiny or dull, mesocarp thin to moderately thick, fleshy or fibrous, endocarp composed of robust longitudinal fibres, usually closely appressed to the seed, becoming free at the basal end or not.
Female flower much larger than the male, with imbricate rounded sepals and petals, staminode vestiges minute or absent, ovary unilocular, tipped with 3 massive reflexed stigmas, usually with copious nectar at anthesis, ovule 1, basally attached.
Rachilla distal to pistillate flowers drying after anthesis, portions bearing fruit sometimes becoming brightly coloured.
Germination adjacent-ligular, eophyll bifid or rarely entire with a minute apical cleft.
Seed conforming to the fruit shape or slightly hollowed at the base, with basal hilum and raphe branches anastomosing, endosperm deeply ruminate, embryo basal.
Fruit rather large to 3.5 cm long.
Categories : Areca Arecaceae genera Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Areceae stubs Hidden categories: Articles with short description Short description is different from Wikidata Articles with 'species' microformats All stub articles.
Seed with ruminate endosperm and basal embryo.
Male flower usually opening long before the â, often heavily scented, small, usually with 3 free or fused sepals and 3 free acute valvate petals, stamens 3-24 , pistillode present or absent.
Germination adjacent-ligular, seedling leaf bifid.
Leaves reduplicately pinnate, sometimes flabellate or undivided, often with compound leaflets composed of many folds.
Staminate flowers frequently minute, sessile, or with a stalk formed from the receptacle, calyx with 3 distinct, slightly imbricate, triangular sepals, or cupular with 3 triangular lobes, corolla with 3 triangular, valvate petals, rarely briefly connate at the base, much longer than the sepals, stamens free or briefly epipetalous, 3, 6, 9 or up to 30 or more, filaments short to elongate, anthers linear or sinuous, sometimes very irregular, latrorse or rarely opening by apical pores, pistillode present and conspicuous as a trifid column as long as the stamens, or minute, or often absent.
Leaf petiole short, c. 10 cm long or less, rachis short probably not more than 1 m long, with few iregulalry spaced pinnae.
Solitary or clustering palm tree up to 4 m tall.
Stem slender to moderate, occasionally stilt-rooted, internodes very short to elongate, leaf scars often conspicuous.
Male flowers mostly inserted in pairs, with 6 stamens.
Inflorescence branched to second order with more than 15, spirally arranged, yellowish green, first order branches.
Very small to moderate, solitary or clustered, acaulescent to erect, unarmed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
General description: Solitary or clustering palm tree up to 4 m tall.
Fruit varying from very small to large, with stigmatic remains apical, epicarp smooth, often brightly coloured, mesocarp fibrous or fleshy, endocarp hard, somewhat woody, with longitudinal fibres.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

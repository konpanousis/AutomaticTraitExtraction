Stem c. 1.5-2.5 cm diam.
Minute to large, solitary or clustered, unarmed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms, almost always with a well-defined crownshaft.
The betel-nut palm and its relatives, acaulescent, or erect, diminutive or robust palms of Southeast Asia to West Pacific, with crownshafts, with entire or lobed leaflet tips and a single large bract in the inflorescence, the pistillate flowers borne only at the rachilla bases and with basal hilum on the seed.
It grows a thin, ringed, smooth reddish trunk , to about 5 m tall, a spread of 2 m, with a green crownshaft, topped by a small crown of sparsely pinnate leaves, inflorescence is a pinkish-yellow.
Fruit: 1-3.5 cm.
Fruit globose, ovoid, or spindle-shaped, often brightly coloured, rarely dull brown or green, stigmatic remains apical, epicarp smooth, shiny or dull, mesocarp thin to moderately thick, fleshy or fibrous, endocarp composed of robust longitudinal fibres, usually closely appressed to the seed, becoming free at the basal end or not.
Female flower much larger than the male, with imbricate rounded sepals and petals, staminode vestiges minute or absent, ovary unilocular, tipped with 3 massive reflexed stigmas, usually with copious nectar at anthesis, ovule 1, basally attached.
Rachilla distal to pistillate flowers drying after anthesis, portions bearing fruit sometimes becoming brightly coloured.
Germination adjacent-ligular, eophyll bifid or rarely entire with a minute apical cleft.
Seed conforming to the fruit shape or slightly hollowed at the base, with basal hilum and raphe branches anastomosing, endosperm deeply ruminate, embryo basal.
Fruit rather large to 3.5 cm long.

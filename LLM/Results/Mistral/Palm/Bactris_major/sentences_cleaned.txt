Widespread, common palm in Central and South America.
Stems can be as narrow as 0.3-0.5 centimetres in B.aubletiana or as broad as 25 centimetres in B. gasipaes.
Large, buttressed fig trees are sometimes found with trunks exceeding 1 meter diameter.
Strong upright palm producing many stout canes 6-8 m. tall and 5 cm.

The Bactris major Jacq. is a monoecious species forming thick tufts with erect or slightly bent stems, 2-10 m tall and of 2-6 cm of diameter, covered by the foliare bases provided of robust blackish spines, up to 10 cm long, except in the oldest parts, smooth, of dark green colour and with the prominent and whitish rings of the foliar scares spaced of 12-25 cm.
Bactris major variation major es una planta de la familia Arecaceae.
They have simple or pinnately compound leaves and yellow, orange, red or purple-black fruit.

All species have spiny leaves, the spines are often clustered on the petiole or rachis.
Shrub, Caespitose palm.
Bactris major is a small to medium-sized spiny palm which ranges from Mexico, through Central America into northern South America and Trinidad.
Flowers grow in triplets along the inflorescence, each female flower is flanked by two male flowers, elsewhere along the inflorescence male flowers grow singly or in pairs.
Stems cespitose, forming dense or open clumps, 1-10 m tall, 2-6 cm diam., spiny on internodes.
The leaves, on a 0,3-1 m long petiole, are pinnate, 0,8-2,2 m long, with 24-46 pairs of oblong-linear pinnules regularly arranged along the rachis and on the same level, 25-60 cm long and 1-3 cm broad, with margin provided of tiny spines or bristles, petiole and rachis are covered by short spines interspersed by some brown or black spines, 1-6 cm long, except at the base of the petiole where they may exceed the 10 cm.
Inflorescences interfoliar, peduncular bract 27-40 cm long, sparsely covered with black spines to 1 cm long, rachillae 1-7, 9-15 cm long, pistillate flowers and fruits usually without a staminodial ring between the calyx and corolla, fruits 1.5-3 x 01-Feb cm, obovoid or ellipsoid, brown or purple-black, with minute spinules or small brown scales.
The leaves can be either pinnately compound or simple, in some species like B. hirta both types of leaves exist.
They had relatively thick husk, oblong shape, and moderately thick shell.

In some species the spines are only found on the tips of the leaflets. : 4-5  Most species grow in multi-stemmed clumps with stems about 2 metres tall and 3 centimetres in diameter, but they span a range of sizes from tall trees to shrubs with subterranean stems and are sometimes single-stemmed.
Ramified inflorescences among the leaves initially enclosed in a spiny spathe, semi-woody and persistent in fruit, 35-60 cm long, with greenish yellow unisexual flowers usually arranged in triad , the female flowers ripe before the male ones thus favouring the crossed pollination.

Petioles range from 5 centimetres to over 1.5 metres in length, while the rachis can be 3 centimetres to over 3 metres long. : 4-5  Inflorescences are borne singly emerging from the leaf axil.
Stems generally bear spines on the internodes, in B. glaucescens and B. setulosa spines are also present on the nodes.
Most species are small trees about 2 m tall, but some are large trees while others are shrubs with subterranean stems.

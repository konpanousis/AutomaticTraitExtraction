We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Syagrus inajai.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

The sepal and petal present an epidermis covered by cuticle on both.sides, thicker on the adaxial side, the mesophyll consists of vascular.bundles surrounded by a sclerenchyma sheath, and present groups of.sclerenchyma cells close to the abaxial surface, in high quantities in.the sepals.
The inflorescence is interfoliar, pedunculate, branched to one.order, and pale yellow, with a strong, sweet odor, 62-82 cm in length.
Germination adjacent-ligular or remote tubular, eophyll entire.
The external surface is.waxy bronze-brown, with lanugo at the base and longitudinal grooves, the.internal surface is glabrous and golden, but after opening, it oxidizes,.changing in color.

Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association.

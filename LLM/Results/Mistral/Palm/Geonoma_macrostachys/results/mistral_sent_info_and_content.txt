We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Geonoma macrostachys.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Rank: GERMINATING.
Geonoma supracostata differs from all forms of G. macrostachys in the combination of an usually well developed aerial stem and moderately dissected leaves with the veins sharply raised alternately on the adaxial and the abaxial side of the lamina.
Plants 1.3 m tall, stems 0.3 m tall, 1.9 cm in diameter, solitary or clustered, not cane-like, internodes 0.2 cm long, not scaly.
This a colourful understory palm.
Leaves 9 per stem, undivided or irregularly pinnate, not plicate, bases of blades running diagonally into the rachis, sheaths 13.2 cm long, petioles 35.5 cm long, drying green or yellowish, rachis 46.1 cm long, 3.7 mm in diameter, veins raised and rectangular in cross-section adaxially or not raised or slightly raised and triangular in cross-section adaxially, pinnae 3 per side of rachis, basal pinna 24.5 cm long, 4.4 cm wide, forming an angle of 39 ° with the rachis, apical pinna 20.8 cm long, 8.8 cm wide, forming an angle of 31 ° with the rachis.
The new leaves are completely lacking in chlorophyll.
They are extremely variable and some, apart from their non-raised veins, resemble the large-raised morphotype.
Undivided & irregularly pinnate.
Staminate flowers have well-developed connectives, jointed at the apices of the filament, and alternately long and short.
They have pinnate leaves with nonraised veins, 4 pinnae with wide basal angles of 51 °, and well-developed connectives.

In leaf color this morphotype resembles the atrovirens morphotype, but has well-developed connectives.
The leaves are described on labels as dark green, blue green, 'almost black', 'nearly black', or 'dark black-green'.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

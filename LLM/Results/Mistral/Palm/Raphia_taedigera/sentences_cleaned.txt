The filaments are separated or basally connate into a tube.
The leaves, on 1,5 m long unarmed petioles, are pinnate, ascending with curved apex, up to more than 10 m long, with 100-200 pairs of lanceolate linear pinnules, up to 1,2 m long, slightly drooping, irregularly arranged and on different angles giving the leaf a feathery look, with margins and central nervation provided with small thorns.
Three petals much longer and connate basally in a tube approximately 1/4 to 1/3 of its length.
Most palms are distinguished by their large, compound, evergreen leaves, known as fronds, arranged at the top of an unbranched stem.

Raphia farinifera, also known as Raffia Palm, is a tropical palm tree native to Africa that can grow up to ten meters high and 60 cm in trunk diameter.
Three petals connate basally in a tube of approximately half its length.
Profile tubular with two keels.
Inflorescence branched up to 3 orders, more or less elongate-cylindrical.
From 95-205 leaflets per side, subequal, narrow , more or less regularly spaced, arranged in several planes, with transverse veins adaxially more or less prominent, sometimes more or less pruinosas abaxially, spiny inconspicuously more or less along the margins and midrib adaxially.
Narrow pinnae arranged in various planes.
Leaf-blades pinnately compound, 5 to 10 + m. long, Unarmed rachis.
Leaf-blades pinnately compound, extremely long.
Ramified second order inflorescences produced at the same time between the reduced leaves and bracts at the apex of the stem, 1-3 m long, hanging, carrying unisexual flowers, the male ones at the apex of the ramifications, the female ones at the base, once the fructification is completed the stem dies, but the plants continues its life by means of the new stems emitted at the base.
The "trunks" consist mainly of petiole bases.
The stems have negatively geotropic adventitious roots between the bases of the dead petioles.
Sepals connate in a tube irregularly lobed.
Petioles beyond sheath between 1.5 and 5 + m. long, Unarmed, deeply concave adaxially, with the sheath split.
Flowers unisexual, and bracteoladas bracteate, mostly solitary, usually between statistical and tetrx¡sticamente arranged.
Ripe fruits of 4.5 to 6.8 x 3.2 to 4 cm.
Very Moist.
Male flowers 7 to 10 mm.
The fruits resemble a hard, glossy, unopened pine cone, 5-7 cm long x 3-4 cm wide.
Native to the Darién Gap on the border between Colombia and Panama, it grows from 1 to 6 metres tall with large, deeply-divided leaf blades.
Stems erect, often cespitose, solitary and clustering , 3 to 12 + m. high, and 25 and 60 cm.
The plants in the base are surrounded by more or less dense masses of pneumatophores branched.
Female flowers 7 to 9 mm.
Flores masculinas de 7 a 10 mm.
Cespitous, even 4 m tall, has very decorative leaves.
Ellipsoid fruits, 5-7 cm long and of 3-4 cm of diameter, covered by imbricate glossy reddish brown scales containing one seed only.
The stems remain alive by the plants' life by means of the new stems emitted at the base, with the male ones at the apex of the stem producing at the same time as the reduced leaves and bracts at the base, 1-3 m long, hanging, carrying unisexual flowers, the male ones at the base dies if the fructification is complete, but the stem will remain healthy as a result.
The female flowers are born in the rachillae baseline, the male distally.
From 8-11 stamens.
The multiple fruits resemble a hard, glossy, unopened pine cone, 5-7 cm long x 3-4 cm wide.
Soboliferous, making a mass of great ascending and arching leaves and trunks arising from the mass 8-9 m. or more and as much as 30 cm.
Spacing: 10-12 ft. 12-15 ft.
Flowering occurs when the tree is about 20-25 years old, and it takes another five years from flowering to ripe fruit.
Leaves are long and arching up to 30' in length.
Sterile anthers short, flattened and sagittate.
The Raphia taedigera Mart. is a generally cespitous, monoecious, monocarpic species, with erect close stems, 1-4 m tall and of 25-40 cm of diameter, covered by the persistent foliar bases and surrounded at the base by a thick mass of small aerial roots.
Rachis 1 to 3 m. long.

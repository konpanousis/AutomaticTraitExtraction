We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Manicaria saccifera.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The fruit is 4 - 6cm in diameter.
Stem solitary, to 10 m tall, 15-20 cm in diameter.
It grows vertically with a wavy surface and 30cm in dia.
Each tree produces four fruit bunches per year, which is about 6-7kg of fruits.

Fruits 35 cm in diameter.
Tree to 10 m., usually growing in colonies, trunks to 30 cm.
Tree, Caespitose palm.
Fruit large, rounded, 1-3-lobed, 1-3-seeded, stigmatic remains subbasal, epicarp obsolescent at maturity, outer mesocarp woody, covered in wart-like projections, inner mesocarp spongy, tanniniferous, endocarp thin, smooth.
The leaves grow in a pinnate shape, and resemble large feathers with irregular separation and serrated edges.
Robust, solitary or clustered, unarmed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
Acaulescent palm of Central and South America with large mostly undivided leaf, held erect and instantly recognisable by the net-like prophyll and peduncular bract that cover the entire inflorescence, fruit corky-warted.
The fruit is covered with a spline outer coating.
A ripe fruit weighs about 38g.
Rank: FLOWERING.
Latin Name Common Name Habit Height Hardiness Growth Soil Shade Moisture Edible Medicinal Other.
Leaves 3-6 m long.
It has one of the largest known leaves in the plant kingdom.
The leaves are split down the midrib and the halves laid obliquely on the rafters, so that the furrows formed by the veins lie in a nearly vertical direction and serve as so many little gutters to carry off the water more rapidly.
Manicaria saccifera is an evergreen Tree growing to 10 m by 10 m at a medium rate.
Spacing: 8-10 ft. 10-12 ft.
Stem rather short, erect or leaning, sometimes dichotomously branched, conspicuously ringed with leaf scars, enlarged and with a mass of roots evident basally.
The fruits grow in large clusters throughout the year, forming in shells that contain two or three seeds each.
Seed rounded, basally attached, raphe branches sunken, parallel, sparsely branched, endosperm homogeneous, hollow, embryo basal.
Inflorescences solitary, interfoliar, Additional figures: Glossary figs 7, 20.
It has enormous entire, to irregularly split leaves.
Commonly found in South America, Manicaria saccifera or commonly known as Ubussu is an evergreen, large, single-stemmed palm of up to 10 m tall and 15 - 20 cm stem diameter.
Inflorescence borne among the leaves, to 60 cm long.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

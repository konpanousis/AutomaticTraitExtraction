Trunk 7 - 20 m tall, c. 13 - 25 cm diam. , swollen at the base, internodes c. 7 - 10 cm, brown, scars irregular, c. 3 - 6 cm, brighter coloured, wood extremely hard, yellowish brown, bark pale brown, hard.
Solitary, pinnate leaf, Madagascan palm with somewhat drooping leaflets and ringed trunk.
Leaflets have a slightly premorse end , which is more exaggerated in juvenile plants.
Trunk 7 - 20 m tall, c. 13 - 25 cm diam. , swollen at the base, internodes c. 7 - 10 cm, brown, scars irregular, c. 3 - 6 cm, brighter coloured, wood extremely hard, yellowish brown, bark pale brown, hard.
The leaf sheath sometimes splits to leave a tongue-like structure, reaching up to the proximal leaflets, producing an apparent petiole.
This species can be quite variable in size, from a compact, small palm to a canopy tree.

Rank: FLOWERING.
Interesting looking seeds with that distinct 'cap' on them.
From this point both the radicle and first seedling leaf emerge.

Abaxial juvenile leaflet and rachis surfaces with striking thin white coating.
In the middle part, leaflets elongate-lanceolate, regularly arranged, c. 55 - 65 on each side of rachis, the proximal 2 leaflets in a pair, the middle part with 2 leaflets crowded c. 2 cm distant, otherwise c. 5 cm distant, c. 68.5 - 84 cm long, 2.5 - 5 cm wide, adaxial surface with thin white indumentum and wax, thin red-brown tomentum on midrib, midrib robust, other ribs less robust, abaxial surface with dense white indumentum, red-brown tomentum on the midrib and margins, midrib robust, other ribs thicker than adaxial, ramenta present, red-brown, mainly on midrib and sparsely on other ribs.
It was approximately eight inches long, with an extremely long tail, and weighed about 7.5 grams.
Leaves. pinnate with two or more leaflets.
It is indeed aptly named because it has a slender trunk topped by gently arching distichous fronds with waxy grey petioles often also coloured reddish-brown.

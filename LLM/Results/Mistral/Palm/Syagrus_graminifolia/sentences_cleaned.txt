The inflorescences are unbranched or branch once, a single hybrid, S.
The leaves of all but one species, S. smithii , are pinnately compound.
Rank: GERMINATING.
The fruit are edible, ovate-lanceolate, yellow-orange, 2.5-3.5 x 1.6-2.5 cm, with a reddish apex.
It is identifiable by its feather palm pinnate leaves that arch inwards towards a thick stout trunk.
It grows to 4-10m tall, with 8-20 leaves to 2m long.
Description Palms in this genus usually have solitary stems, clustered stems are less common, and a few are stolon -like subterranean.
It is the tallest of all the species in the genus Butia.
They are monoecious , with both male and female flowers borne in the same inflorescence.

Definitie: whole plant growth form.
First fruits.
It is very similar to B. odorata , but is easily distinguished from this species by the distinct spathes which are densely covered in rust-coloured, woolly hairs.
They have simple or pinnately compound leaves and yellow, orange, red or purple-black fruit.
Rank: SEEDLING.
The stems are normally spineless, but some species have spiny leaf sheaths or spines.
The transition from the leaf sheath to the petiole can be gradual and difficult to identify, but in species where they can be distinguished, leaf sheaths are 2.5-180 cm long and the petioles are 0-30 cm.
They range in size from 1.2 to 1.9   cm in length, and 0.7 to 4.5   cm in diameter.
The fruit are drupes, which vary in colour from green to orange to brown.
In rare cases, this palm can grow to 10 feet , with a trunk diameter of about 3 + 1 ⁄ 2 inches.
Geonoma is a genus of small to medium-sized palms native to the forest understorey of tropical Central and South America.
Rank: FLOWERING.
Butia stolonifera was an oddly growing palm assigned to the genus Butia found only once in Uruguay in the 19th century, but which now is considered to be uncertain as a valid species.
x lacerdamourae , occasionally shows second-order branching, and emerge from between the leaves.
The palm has a small stature, only growing to a height of 6 feet.
Those species that have upright trunks grow 2–36 metres tall with stems that are 6–35 centimetres in diameter.
The transition from the leaf sheath to the petiole can be gradual and difficult to identify, but in species where they can be distinguished, leaf sheaths are 2.5–180   cm long and the petioles are 0–30   cm.
A small palm with very glaucous leaves.
Those species that have upright trunks grow 2-36 metres tall with stems that are 6-35 centimetres in diameter.
It is caespitose, branching underground with normally 3-6 branches.
Definitie: An autotroph which is capable of transforming light into chemical energy.
The leaves are bent at the end, with very hairy margins near the trunk, and consist of 180-320 slightly coiled leaflets irregularly arranged in several planes on the rake.
Most species are small trees about 2 m tall, but some are large trees while others are shrubs with subterranean stems.
They range in size from 1.2 to 1.9 cm in length, and 0.7 to 4.5 cm in diameter.
A small palm with very blueish pinnate leaves.
The fruit are oval, greenish-yellow, 6–9 cm long.
It grows to 60–160 cm tall, with 5-12 leaves with 24-40 leaflets a side.
Palms in this genus usually have solitary stems, clustered stems are less common, and a few are stolon -like subterranean.
This slow-growing palm grows up to 10m, although it is often less tall.

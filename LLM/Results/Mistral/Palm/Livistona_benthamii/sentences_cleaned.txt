Seed ovoid, 8-9 mm long.
The leaves are costapalmate, corrugated, almost circular, 0,8-1,5 m long, of intense green colour and glossy above, slightly paler below, divided in 60-80 segments, 2,5-3 cm broad, united at the base for about 1/3-1/4 of their length, the free part is in its turn divided up to about the half in two linear-lanceolate segments with acute apex slightly diverging and drooping.
Ari.Hi Ari, the bronzy under leaf fulva colour doesn't happen till a little older.

Segments 29-39 either side of costa, largest segments 23-32 mm wide, broadening slightly toward point of bifurcation, free for 60-75% of their length, bifurcated for 50-65% of free length, the lobes slightly diverging, evenly tapering into soft, early-necrotic, acute apices.

Livistona benthamii is a large canopy palm to 18 m tall, with long retained petiole stubs, leaves are moderate to large and regularly segmented, segment apices are pendulous, and with a bifurcate cleft to 75% of the segment length, the inflorescence is unbranched, not extending beyond the limit of the crown, and with up to 9 partial inflorescences, bracts are tightly sheathing, flowers are whitish cream to pale yellow, fruit are globose to obovoid o pyriform, to 13 mm long to 11 mm wide, and pruinose purple black at maturity.
In the second there appears to be old inflorescence extending to the left, far beyond the leaf crown.

Partial inflorescences c. 9, subequal , short relative to rachis, rachillae 5-12 cm long, 0.6-0.7 mm thick, reddish-brown , finely and closely but shallowly striate, minutely but patchily strigose - pubescent with twisted, semi- appressed hairs.
Flowers c. 1.5 mm long.

Rachis bracts flattened-cylindrical, the largest 20-22 mm diameter, smooth and tightly sheathing , very stiffly coriaceous and rather hard, pinkish-brown ageing to red-brown or greyish, finely but shallowly striate, patchily clothed with closely appressed silvery scales, bract apices triangular- ovate , smoothly acuminate.
At that size benthamii are usually much much finer.Peachy.

Eophyll not seen.
The petioles, 1,4-2 m long and 1-2 cm broad, of pale green colour but when close to the base where they display reddish brown hues, are provided in the lowest half of blackish brown spines irregularly arranged and variously curved, of variable length up to 1 cm, almost unarmed in the remaining part, the foliar base falls apart for a good part in a fibrous mass surrounding the stem.
Seed subspherical or slightly ovoid , flattened ventrally, 8-9 x 7-8 mm, surface smooth and dark brown.
Anthopodium 0.3-0.5mm long, wider than long, recessed at base and bluntly trigonous.
Attractive and stately tall single stemmed palm with handsome round drooping crown and large spiky fan-shaped leaves.
Petiole 160-180 cm long, 10-18 mm wide, roughly semi-circular in t.s. with slightly flared margins and 2 concave grooves either side of a median ridge above.
Surfaces olive-green, duller beneath, drying to pinkish-brown above contrasting strongly with greenish-brown beneath, glabrous except for few white chaffy scales on bases of ribs.
Flower-clusters 1-4 mm apart, 1-2-flowered, cluster axis 0.5-1.2 mm long, cylindrical or somewhat bulging.

Hastula flat with upturned edges to semi cylindrical, base broadly 2-lobed with shallow median notch or 3-lobed with lateral lobes wider than central.
Deeply cut,.glossy, dark green palmate leaves, and petiole stubs adhering.to the trunk distinguish this species.
Trunk to 18 m tall, 13-20 cm dbh, leaf scars raised, internodes narrow, grey, petiole stubs long because of the abscission of leaves occurring in about the middle of the petiole, stubs persistent on the trunk for most of its length, unless decayed by age or fire.
Also the teeth on the petioles are huge and curved and very sharp.
In the lower part of the stem, for a height of 4-6 m, remain for long time the stumps of the petioles, up to 50-60 cm long, arranged almost horizontally.
Trunk to 18 m tall, 13-20 cm in diam.
Flowers solitary or in clusters of 2-3, tubular, whitish/cream to pale yellow, sepals triangular, 0.8-2 mm long, membranous, acute, petals broadly triangular, 1.0-1.3 mm long, fleshy, acute, stamens ca 1 mm long.
Inflorescences between the leaves , of less long or equal length than that of the petioles, of cream white to yellowish colour, with ramifications of second order and several rachillae, of various length up to about 12 cm, with tiny sessile hermaphroditic flowers, solitary or in groups of 2-3, with 6 stamens united at the base and 3 carpels free at the base and united to the apex forming a unique style with trilobate stigma.
In full sun the petioles shorten.and older leaves scorch, but a reasonable specimen is.produced.
Stamens slightly shorter than petals, connate for 25-30% of their length, filaments thick, broadly triangular-ovate, gently rounded either side toward base, tapering smoothly to a slender apex.
Epicarp blackish when ripe with thin glaucous bloom, quite smooth, thin and weak.
Margins virtually unarmed in upper half, toward base armed with ± closely spaced pungent , narrowly triangular- conical , patent to retrorse shiny brownish-black prickles to 6 mm long.
Surface fairly smooth, vertical fissures numerous and regular but shallow, basal 5 m or so usually bearing persistent, patent or slightly deflexed 10-40 cm long petiole-stubs.
Major longitudinal veins 6-9 either side of abaxial rib, prominent above and below, transverse veins evident both sides but more prominent below, mostly at low angles to longitudinal veins.

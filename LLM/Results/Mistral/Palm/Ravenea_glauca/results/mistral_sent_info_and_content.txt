We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Ravenea glauca.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Rank: SEEDLING.
The slender trunk is small caliper up to 4 inch diameter, solitary with no crown-shaft.
It is a very large palm with a large, untidy crown.
Spacing: 6-8 ft.
Trees grow from 1.5–8 meters in height, and 13–30 cm in diameter.

Pagina 2 van 5 • 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5.
The leaf is flat with no recurve to it and the leaflets usually hold on a flat or slightly arching plane.
Ravenea glauca, crown young.
A really stunning smaller growing palm with a crown of finely divided leaflets.
Petiole/Leaf bases : 1' long, slightly channeled, unarmed, ventral surface with a thick layer of white tomentum- almost spongy near very base, un-split.
As can be seen from the photos, this species can attain heights more than the 15-26 ft that most references claim, on a slender 3-4 inch trunk.
The leaves are more of a gray green color as well and not as upright the way they attach and are held on the palm.
The inflorescence is short, borne among the leaves, the fruit is a red drupe.
Individuals can grow to 8 m.
Height : 20' estimated.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.
The base of each frond is green, yet they become white to dark grey near the tip at maturity.
One being the heavily tomentosed leaf bases and bottom of the petioles.
Rare Palms.
The abaxial side of the leaf is always glaucous and the adaxial side, depending on the plant, could be green or even a whitish blue like this amazing specimen below was displaying.

It looks like it has some P. speciosa color in it, but the fronds are more upright and smaller and the new shoots seem to be pink.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

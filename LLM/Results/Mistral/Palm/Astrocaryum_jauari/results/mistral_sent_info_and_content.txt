We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Astrocaryum jauari.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

The stem is from 8 to 12 feet high, irregularly ringed, and armed with long, scattered "black spines.
Stem solitary, to 20 m tall and 30 cm in diameter, armed with long black spines.
Symphysodon discus - BLUE FACE.
Symphysodon discus - G RAY GREEN.
Extremely spiny pinnate-leaved palms from Central and South America, distinctive in the marked separation of pistillate flowers from the staminate part of the rachilla.
Discus Gray Green Ituqui - Symphysodon discus.

Astrocaryum is a genus of about 36 to 40 species of palms native to Central and South America and Trinidad.

Leaves forming a funnel shaped crown, erect and arching, neatly abscising, 4-6 m long, pinnae to 150 on each side, evenly spaced or grouped, spreading in different planes, the central ones to 110 cm long and 3.5 cm wide.
The fruit is of a moderate size, oval, of a yellowish color, and with a small quantity of rather juicy eatable pulp covering the seed.
Pistillate flower very much larger than the staminate, calyx urn-shaped or cup-shaped, truncate or shallowly 3-lobed, sometimes bearing numerous short spicules, usually densely tomentose, corolla not, briefly, or considerably exceeding, and similar to the calyx, or composed of 3 imbricate triangular lobes, connate basally, staminodes 6, epipetalous near the base of the corolla, connate into a low membranous ring or tooth-like, gynoecium varied in shape, trilocular, triovulate, the 3 large fleshy erect, or head-like, reflexed stigmas borne on a beak, protruding through the mouth of the corolla tube, sometimes bearing short spines and/or tomentum, ovule ?
The leaves are terminal and of moderate size, regularly pinnate, the leaflets spreading out uniformly in one plane, elongate, acute, with the terminal pair shorter and broader.
Face - Symphysodon discus - Acara disco selvagem.
Staminate flowers small, ± symmetrical, sepals 3, very small, ± triangular, ?
Discus Solid - Symphysodon discus.
Moderate to robust, solitary or clustered, sometimes acaulescent, spiny, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
Fruit 1-seeded with apical stigmatic remains, beaked, spherical, top-shaped, prismatic, or ovoid, often brightly coloured, brown, yellowish or orange-red, calyx and corolla persistent, enlarged and irregularly splitting, epicarp spiny or unarmed, tomentose or glabrous, mesocarp relatively thin, fleshy or dry and starchy, and fibrous, sometimes with the epicarp irregularly splitting and spreading to expose the endocarp, endocarp thick, stony, with numerous flattened, black longitudinal fibres on the surface, conspicuously radiating from the 3 subterminal pores.
It is an emergent or subcanopy tree that grows on river banks and islands, with a wide distribution along the entire flooding gradient, tolerating flood durations between 30 and 340 days.
Seed irregularly globular, basally attached, hilum circular, raphe branches anastomosing, endosperm homogeneous, usually hollow, embryo subapical, opposite one of the endocarp pores.
The petioles and sheathing bases are thickly covered with long black spines generally directed downward, and often 8 inches long.
Fruits obovoid, greyish green, turning yellow or orange at maturity, glabrous, 3-4 cm long.
The spathes are elongate, splitting open and deciduous.
Stem very short to tall, often slender, obscured by leaf bases, or becoming bare and conspicuously ringed with leaf scars, often armed with fierce spines pointing in several directions, sometimes losing spines with age.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

Here is the dictionary of traits with sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples based on the input text:

}
```

Note: The values for "Fruit colour" and "Fruit size" were inferred from the input text, but the exact colors and size descriptions were not provided in the initial dictionary. Therefore, I used the closest matching values available. For "Fruit colour", I used "yellow" since the fruit is described as "pale yellow-green". For "Fruit size", I used "small" since the fruit is described as "1" long.

Also, please note that the "Crown", "Fruit shape", and "Conspicuousness" traits do not have any strong evidence in the input text, so their binary values are all set to 0.

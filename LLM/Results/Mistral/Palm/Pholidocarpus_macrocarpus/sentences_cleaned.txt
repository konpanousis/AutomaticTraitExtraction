Palm tree up to 30 m tall.
It is closely related to Livistona but easily distinguished by its very large, corky fruits.
Tall, single-stemmed hermaphroditic fan-palms of South Thailand and Malesia eastwards to the Moluccas, leaves have fiercely toothed petioles and blades that are divided by deep and shallow splits to form deeply lobed segments, most species have large corky-warted fruit.
Tall single trunk reaching 30-40 m, Leaf palmate about 2 m diameter, segmented commences at center or one third way to stalk, petiole length, 2.5-3 m, with sharp thorns, Inflorescence/spadix emerges at petiole axial, fruit oval 8-10 cm in diameter, corky with knurled-textured surface, flesh orange color.
Not all leaf divisions to centre, some only 1/3 way in to stalk.
Has deeply divided, somewhat drooping huge fan leaves on long petioles.
Spacing: 15-20 ft. 20-30 ft.
Stem 25-30 cm in diam.
They have very colorful double yellow stripped petiole.
Leaf sheath dissolved in abundant, reddish brown, fibrous mesh, apically extended in up to 40 cm long ligule, petiole 1.6-2.5 m long, glossy dark green, abaxially with two longitudinal stripes, armed with straight 4-5 cm long, basally swollen spines, distantly inserted and decreasing in length towards the distal end, blade untidy looking with age, up to 2 m across, divided almost to the hastula in 12-14, 3-4-folded segment groups, these again divided to 1/3-2/3 of the radius into single-folded segments, with stiff to eventually drooping tips.
Inflorescence, peduncle and rachis more or less equal in length, 0.8-1 m, first order branches 5-7, rachillae numerous, 15-25 cm long.
Rank: FLOWERING.
Leaf , floral anatomy not studied.
Flowers sessile, golden-yellow, calyx cup-shaped, shallowly 3-lobed, glabrous or sparsely hairy, corolla divided almost to the base into 3 triangular, valvate, glabrous or sparsely hairy petals, stamens 6, filaments united to form a conspicuous tube, free from the corolla, shallowly 6-lobed, tipped with short, slender, distinct filaments, bearing ± rounded or oblong, dorsifixed, introrse anthers, gynoecium tricarpellate, distinctly conical, hairy, the carpels distinct from each other basally, united apically in a long slender style, tipped with a dot-like stigma, ovule basally attached, anatropous.
It sports a very tall, slender, solitary trunk that carries a large, spherical crown of bright green, fan-shaped leaves held on fiercely armed leaf stalks with two characteristic yellow stripes.
Seed attached laterally or near the base, endosperm massive, homogeneous, but penetrated on one side by a large convoluted intrusion of seed coat, embryo subbasal or lateral.

Inflorescences interfoliar, emerging from the leaf sheath mouths and arching out of the crown, branching to 4 orders, several axils producing inflorescences simultaneously, peduncle robust, prophyll tubular, 2-keeled, somewhat inflated, peduncular bracts 1-ca.

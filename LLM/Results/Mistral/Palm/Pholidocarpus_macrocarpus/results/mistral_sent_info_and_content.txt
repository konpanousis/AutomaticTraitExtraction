We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Pholidocarpus macrocarpus.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Palm tree up to 30 m tall.
It is closely related to Livistona but easily distinguished by its very large, corky fruits.
Tall, single-stemmed hermaphroditic fan-palms of South Thailand and Malesia eastwards to the Moluccas, leaves have fiercely toothed petioles and blades that are divided by deep and shallow splits to form deeply lobed segments, most species have large corky-warted fruit.
Tall single trunk reaching 30-40 m, Leaf palmate about 2 m diameter, segmented commences at center or one third way to stalk, petiole length, 2.5-3 m, with sharp thorns, Inflorescence/spadix emerges at petiole axial, fruit oval 8-10 cm in diameter, corky with knurled-textured surface, flesh orange color.
Not all leaf divisions to centre, some only 1/3 way in to stalk.
Has deeply divided, somewhat drooping huge fan leaves on long petioles.
Spacing: 15-20 ft. 20-30 ft.
Stem 25-30 cm in diam.
They have very colorful double yellow stripped petiole.
Leaf sheath dissolved in abundant, reddish brown, fibrous mesh, apically extended in up to 40 cm long ligule, petiole 1.6-2.5 m long, glossy dark green, abaxially with two longitudinal stripes, armed with straight 4-5 cm long, basally swollen spines, distantly inserted and decreasing in length towards the distal end, blade untidy looking with age, up to 2 m across, divided almost to the hastula in 12-14, 3-4-folded segment groups, these again divided to 1/3-2/3 of the radius into single-folded segments, with stiff to eventually drooping tips.
Inflorescence, peduncle and rachis more or less equal in length, 0.8-1 m, first order branches 5-7, rachillae numerous, 15-25 cm long.
Rank: FLOWERING.
Leaf , floral anatomy not studied.
Flowers sessile, golden-yellow, calyx cup-shaped, shallowly 3-lobed, glabrous or sparsely hairy, corolla divided almost to the base into 3 triangular, valvate, glabrous or sparsely hairy petals, stamens 6, filaments united to form a conspicuous tube, free from the corolla, shallowly 6-lobed, tipped with short, slender, distinct filaments, bearing ± rounded or oblong, dorsifixed, introrse anthers, gynoecium tricarpellate, distinctly conical, hairy, the carpels distinct from each other basally, united apically in a long slender style, tipped with a dot-like stigma, ovule basally attached, anatropous.
It sports a very tall, slender, solitary trunk that carries a large, spherical crown of bright green, fan-shaped leaves held on fiercely armed leaf stalks with two characteristic yellow stripes.
Seed attached laterally or near the base, endosperm massive, homogeneous, but penetrated on one side by a large convoluted intrusion of seed coat, embryo subbasal or lateral.

Inflorescences interfoliar, emerging from the leaf sheath mouths and arching out of the crown, branching to 4 orders, several axils producing inflorescences simultaneously, peduncle robust, prophyll tubular, 2-keeled, somewhat inflated, peduncular bracts 1-ca.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.
Flesh orange with strong apricot smell.
Fruit 10-12 cm in diam., corky-warty, brown at maturity.
Stem erect, ringed with inconspicuous, close leaf scars.
Pollen ellipsoidal, symmetric or slightly asymmetric, aperture a distal sulcus, ectexine tectate, coarsely perforate, perforate or finely reticulate, aperture margin occasionally finer, infratectum columellate, longest axis 34-37 µm.
Fruit developing from 1 carpel, very large, globose, stigmatic remains scarcely visible but apical, pericarp massive, the epicarp smooth , or cracked into numerous low corky brown warts, mesocarp thick, ± fleshy, frequently traversed by radiating fibres, endocarp crustaceous.
Robust, solitary, armed, pleonanthic, hermaphroditic, tree palms.
Fruit 10-12 cm diam., corky-warty, brown at maturity.
Germination remote-tubular, eophyll entire, lanceolate, plicate.
Tall single trunk reaching 30-40m, Leaf palmate ca.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

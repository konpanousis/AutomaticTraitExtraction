The inflorescences are unbranched or branch once, a single hybrid, S.
Palms in this genus usually have solitary stems, clustered stems are less common, and a few are stolon -like subterranean.
The leaves of all but one species, S. smithii , are pinnately compound.
Leaf , root , fruit.
Rank: GERMINATING.
Seed conforming to the shape of the endocarp cavity, subbasally attached, endosperm homogeneous or ruminate, sometimes with a central cavity, embryo basal or subbasal opposite one of the endocarp pores.
Last years strap leaf spotted a bit, but this years leaves look fine.
.Solitary, robust tree palm, to 10 m tall.
Staminate flowers in distal two-fifths of rachilla, 11 x 11 mm, white, pistillate flowers in proximal three-fifths of rachilla, 8 x 7 mm.
Graceful undergrowth palms from eastern Brazil with distinctive slender discolorous leaflets and fruit in which the pericarp splits longitudinally when ripe, exposing the endocarp.
Extremely variable genus native to the Caribbean and South America, where it is particularly abundant in drier areas, leaflets are concolourous and the mesocarp does not split.
Trunk 30 cm diam., flared or slightly.enlarged at base, ringed, internodes 3-10 cm.
They are monoecious , with both male and female flowers borne in the same inflorescence.
Fruit 3-3.2 x 3 cm, ovoid, orange.
Rank: SEEDLING.
The stems are normally spineless, but some species have spiny leaf sheaths or spines.
The transition from the leaf sheath to the petiole can be gradual and difficult to identify, but in species where they can be distinguished, leaf sheaths are 2.5-180 cm long and the petioles are 0-30 cm.
Seed laterally attached with broad lateral hilum, endosperm homogeneous or deeply ruminate , with or without a central hollow, embryo basal opposite an endocarp pore.
The fruit are drupes, which vary in colour from green to orange to brown.
Its leaves arranged in five, distinct, vertically spiraling rows and trunk leaf scars are similar to those of S. coronata, and it has the.appearance of a very robust form of this.species.
Rank: FLOWERING.
Fruit small to relatively large, 1-seeded, spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal, variously green, brown, yellow, or reddish, sometimes beaked, the perianth segments and staminodal ring persistent and sometimes enlarging as a cupule at the fruit base, epicarp smooth or longitudinally striate, glabrous or hairy, mesocarp fleshy or dry, with abundant longitudinal fibres, endocarp thick, woody, with 3 basal or subbasal pores, sometimes beaked, sometimes with 3 longitudinal ridges, rarely with 3 irregular vertical bands of minute pores, endocarp cavity irregular or more usually circular, rarely triangular in cross-section, with 3, conspicuous, vertical lines, very rarely with a curved lateral protrusion into the seed.
Pistillate flowers slightly smaller to very much larger than the staminate flowers, sepals 3, distinct, broadly imbricate, triangular to ovate, acute or obtuse, fleshy to coriaceous, sometimes tomentose or scaly, petals 3, distinct, slightly shorter to slightly longer the than the sepals, triangular or ovate, broadly imbricate at the base, with minute to moderately large and conspicuous valvate tips, staminodal ring membranous, low, ± 6-toothed, occasionally apparently absent, gynoecium columnar to conical or ovoid, trilocular, triovulate, glabrous or tomentose to scaly, the stigmas 3, reflexed, fleshy, ovules laterally attached to the central wall of the locules, ?
x lacerdamourae , occasionally shows second-order branching, and emerge from between the leaves.
Stem very short, subterranean to erect and tall, rarely stolon-like, sometimes swollen basally, distally obscured by leaf-base remains, becoming bare, sometimes striate, and marked with inconspicuous or raised or impressed, oblique or circular conspicuous leaf scars.
Long, arching green leaves.
Slender, solitary, unarmed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.
Those species that have upright trunks grow 2-36 metres tall with stems that are 6-35 centimetres in diameter.
This is a small Syagrus to about 2m tall,.sometimes clustered, and with a smooth, 10cm diameter trunk.
It has the one main trunk base with many small suckers beginning to show.
Pollen ellipsoidal, frequently elongate, usually with either slight or obvious asymmetry, aperture a distal sulcus, ectexine tectate, finely or coarsely perforate, perforate and micro-channelled, or perforate-rugulate, aperture margin may be slightly finer, infratectum columellate, longest axis 34-54 µm.
Small to tall, solitary or clustered, rarely forking below ground , unarmed or armed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
Inflorescences solitary, interfoliar, rarely spicate, usually branching to 1 order, ?
Stem erect, short, rarely exceeding 3 m, at first obscured by leaf sheath remains, later bare, closely ringed with leaf scars.
They range in size from 1.2 to 1.9 cm in length, and 0.7 to 4.5 cm in diameter.
Rank: SEED.
Germination adjacent-ligular or remote tubular, eophyll entire.

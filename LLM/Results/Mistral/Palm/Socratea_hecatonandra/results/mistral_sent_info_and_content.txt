We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Socratea hecatonandra.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Arecaceae genera Iriarteeae Neotropical realm flora Palm stubs Hidden categories: Articles with short description Short description is different from Wikidata Articles with 'species' microformats All stub articles.
Moderate solitary pinnate-leaved tree palms ofhumid rain forest in Central and South America, the stems with an opencone of stilt roots, leaflets are rhomboid praemorse, sometimeslongitudinally divided to give the whole leaf an ostrich-featherappearance, fruit has apical stigmatic remains and embryo.
Paphiopedilum insigne Pfitzer.
The large leaflets are divided into several broad, wedge-shaped segments with stiff, jagged tips.
Inflorescences solitary, infrafoliar, somewhat dorsiventrally compressed and erect inbud, branching to 1 order, branches pendulous when exposed,protogynous, peduncle well developed, elliptic in cross-section,winged at base, prophyll inserted near the base, short, tubular, 2-keeled, apically open, thinly coriaceous, peduncular bracts ca.
Solitary or very rarely clustered, moderate, pleonanthic, monoecioustree palms.
Seed ± ovoid, basally attached, hilum circular, raphe branches conspicuous, numerous, sparsely anastomosing, endosperm homogeneous, embryo eccentrically apical.
Staminate flowers open in bud, sepals 3, triangular, united basally in alow, complete or partially interrupted ring, petals 3, distinct, fleshy, markedly asymmetrical, lightly imbricate basally, much longer than the sepals, stamens 17-145, filaments very short, awl-shaped above expanded bases, anthers erect, basifixed, linear, acute or apiculate, latrorse, pistillode much shorter than the stamens, conical, briefly trifid.
Tree, Solitary palm.
Pistillate flowers symmetrical, much smaller than the staminate, ± 3-angled, sepals 3, rounded, strongly imbricate, dorsally thickened, petals 3, distinct, strongly imbricate, ± rounded with a minute, triangular valvate apex, staminodes 6, minute, tooth-like, gynoecium obovoid, tricarpellate, triovulate, stigmas 3, apical, fleshy, reflexed, ovules basally attached, orthotropous, one usually larger than the others.
Fruit separated at maturity, ellipsoidal to subglobose with eccentrically apical stigmatic remains, epicarp minutely roughened when dry, at maturity splitting into ± distinct valves at apex, exposing the rather dry white mesocarp with included reddish sclerosomes and slender fibres, endocarp thin.
A stunning, tall and elegant palm with a slender, smooth trunk than can reach 20 m tall, is supported by a cone of strong stilt roots and carries a magnificent, long, bluish-gray crownshaft which holds up to 7 large, plumose, spreading, dark green leaves.
Stems erect, conspicuously ringed with leaf scars, bearingan open cone of stout, usually densely prickly, stilt roots.
Pollen ellipsoidal, ± bi-symmetric, aperture a distal sulcus, ectexine intectate, upper surface of foot layer covered by fine, dense gemmae or clavae, loosely supporting short, wide-spaced, broad-based spines, longest axis 43-50 µm.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

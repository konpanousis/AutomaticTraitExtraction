The inflorescences are unbranched or branch once, a single hybrid, S.
The leaves of all but one species, S. smithii , are pinnately compound.
Leaf , root , fruit.
Seed conforming to the shape of the endocarp cavity, subbasally attached, endosperm homogeneous or ruminate, sometimes with a central cavity, embryo basal or subbasal opposite one of the endocarp pores.
The Syagrus coronata Becc. is a monoecious species with erect solitary stem, cylindrical, 6-12 m tall and of 20-28 cm of diameter, covered for a large extent under the crown by the residues of the foliar bases arranged helicoidally in five rows, of greyish color and with the prominent annular scars of the junction of the leaves in the oldest part.
This slow-growing, single-stemmed palm will reach up to 30' tall with a 15' spread.
Graceful undergrowth palms from eastern Brazil with distinctive slender discolorous leaflets and fruit in which the pericarp splits longitudinally when ripe, exposing the endocarp.
Extremely variable genus native to the Caribbean and South America, where it is particularly abundant in drier areas, leaflets are concolourous and the mesocarp does not split.

Fibrous, with a slightly sweet flavour.
Description Syagrus coronata reaches 3 to 12 m tall with a crown of attractive, arching, semi-plumose leaves.
They are monoecious , with both male and female flowers borne in the same inflorescence.
The smooth grey trunk is topped with a crown of large, slightly arched compound leaves.
Pendulous clusters of yellow blooms are followed by 1" diameter green fruits that ripen to yellow or orange.
The stems are normally spineless, but some species have spiny leaf sheaths or spines.
Inflorescences between the leaves of yellowish color, about 90 cm long, initially enclosed in a woody spathe externally tomentose, with ramifications of first order and unisexual flowers arranged in triads , but in the terminal part of the rachillae where are present only male flowers solitary or in couple.
A very slow-growing tree.
Yellowish inflorescence of about 90 cm with male and female flowers.
The transition from the leaf sheath to the petiole can be gradual and difficult to identify, but in species where they can be distinguished, leaf sheaths are 2.5-180 cm long and the petioles are 0-30 cm.
Seed laterally attached with broad lateral hilum, endosperm homogeneous or deeply ruminate , with or without a central hollow, embryo basal opposite an endocarp pore.
The fruit are drupes, which vary in colour from green to orange to brown.
Lanceolate male flowers, about 1 cm long, with 3 sepals and 3 petals free and 6 stamens, ovoid female flowers, about 0,6 cm long, with 3 sepals and 3 petals free, trilocular gynaeceum and 3 curved stigmas.
Germination adjacent-ligular or remote tubular, eophyll entire.
Syagrus coronata is an evergreen Tree growing to 10 m by 6 m at a slow rate.
Individual leaves can reach up to 10' long.
The blooms are bright yellow, and the plants bear fruit for most of the year.
x lacerdamourae , occasionally shows second-order branching, and emerge from between the leaves.

Fruit small to relatively large, 1-seeded, spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal, variously green, brown, yellow, or reddish, sometimes beaked, the perianth segments and staminodal ring persistent and sometimes enlarging as a cupule at the fruit base, epicarp smooth or longitudinally striate, glabrous or hairy, mesocarp fleshy or dry, with abundant longitudinal fibres, endocarp thick, woody, with 3 basal or subbasal pores, sometimes beaked, sometimes with 3 longitudinal ridges, rarely with 3 irregular vertical bands of minute pores, endocarp cavity irregular or more usually circular, rarely triangular in cross-section, with 3, conspicuous, vertical lines, very rarely with a curved lateral protrusion into the seed.
Pistillate flowers slightly smaller to very much larger than the staminate flowers, sepals 3, distinct, broadly imbricate, triangular to ovate, acute or obtuse, fleshy to coriaceous, sometimes tomentose or scaly, petals 3, distinct, slightly shorter to slightly longer the than the sepals, triangular or ovate, broadly imbricate at the base, with minute to moderately large and conspicuous valvate tips, staminodal ring membranous, low, ± 6-toothed, occasionally apparently absent, gynoecium columnar to conical or ovoid, trilocular, triovulate, glabrous or tomentose to scaly, the stigmas 3, reflexed, fleshy, ovules laterally attached to the central wall of the locules, ?
Stem very short, subterranean to erect and tall, rarely stolon-like, sometimes swollen basally, distally obscured by leaf-base remains, becoming bare, sometimes striate, and marked with inconspicuous or raised or impressed, oblique or circular conspicuous leaf scars.
The leaves, on short petiole, arranged as aforementioned, are pinnate, 2,5-3 m long, with 90-120 pairs of rigid, linear leaflets, with acuminate apex, in the central part 35-40 cm long and 2-3 cm broad, arranged on the rachis in groups of 2-5 on various angles, of dark green colour above, bluish green and covered by whitish waxy patina below, foliar bases and petioles provided on the margins of flat woody fibres 2-5 cm long.
Its mature height is 3 to 12m , the trunk is about a foot in diameter, and the stiff leaflets are whiteish beneath and are held erect, giving a very handsome appearance.
The leaf bases are persitant, and covered in a white indument, and arranged in roughly 5 spiral rows.
Slender, solitary, unarmed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
Those species that have upright trunks grow 2-36 metres tall with stems that are 6-35 centimetres in diameter.
The fruit is about 26mm long x 20mm wide.
Pollen ellipsoidal, frequently elongate, usually with either slight or obvious asymmetry, aperture a distal sulcus, ectexine tectate, finely or coarsely perforate, perforate and micro-channelled, or perforate-rugulate, aperture margin may be slightly finer, infratectum columellate, longest axis 34-54 µm.
Palms - botanically identified only.
Small to tall, solitary or clustered, rarely forking below ground , unarmed or armed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
They range in size from 1.2 to 1.9 cm in length, and 0.7 to 4.5 cm in diameter.
Stem erect, short, rarely exceeding 3 m, at first obscured by leaf sheath remains, later bare, closely ringed with leaf scars.
Inflorescences solitary, interfoliar, rarely spicate, usually branching to 1 order, ?
Ovoid fruits, 2-2,8 cm long and of 1,4-2 cm of diameter, of orange yellow color and covered by brown tomentum, containing only one ovoid seed about 2,2 cm long and of 1,3 cm of diameter.
The old, dried leaf petioles persist on the trunk and create a spiral pattern.
Palms in this genus usually have solitary stems, clustered stems are less common, and a few are stolon -like subterranean.

The Archontophoenix tuckeri Dowe is an unarmed monoecious species with solitary stem up to 20 m tall, slender, of about 25 cm of diameter, enlarged at the base, on which are visible the rings trace of the attachment of the fallen leaves, and green internodes tending to grey and to fissure with the age.
Prophyll 40-45 x 11-12 cm, thin, fibry, papery, winged, beaked, silvery on the adaxial surface.
Fibres compact when ripe.
It grows very fast, with a beautiful.crownshaft.
The rings on the trunk are due to leaves that leave scars arranged in a regular manner.
New leaves are often in tones of pink, red or bronze, and the juvenile leaves become proportionately larger than in other species before they commence to divide.
Pinnae to 93 x 5 cm, apical third frquently semi- pendulous.
Individuals can grow to 20 m.
Leaves are glaucous underneath, and a much deeper green.
Fruit ovoid , 15-25 x 10-15 mm, bright red to dark brick-red at maturity.
Growing to about 30 meters tall.
The inflorescences are short, branched, pink or red and grow right under the crownshaft.
The “crownshaft” is rather long and slender light green to dark.
The fruits are red and oval or round with an average diameter of 10 to 50mm.
Pinnae have.silver/grey scales below and tend to be semi-pendulous in the.apical 1/3.
Mesocarp fibres in 2 distinct layers, outer of thin fibres and inner of flat, to 3 mm wide, mostly branched fibres.
The leaves are pinnate and dark green color.
The stem is unique , rather thin, smooth, long and light gray.

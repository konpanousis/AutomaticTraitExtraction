Rhapis multifida is probably the most beautiful of all the commonly grown Rhapis palms and is somewhat of a miniaturized version of Rhapis humilis with numerous very slender, delicate pointed leaflets making up each leaf.
Fibres on leaf sheaths.are fine and closely adhere to the canes, giving canes a.slender rather neat appearance.

The leaves are so deeply divided that the leaflets look like separate entities and create the illusion of fingers off a hand.
This species also can be identified by its having ten or more pointed drooping leaflets per leaf and tall, less fiber-covered stems reaching up to 18 feet in some old palms.
This species of Rhapis has a relatively fine leaf sheath and prominent cross veins on the leaf segments, and rachis bracts usually with little or no tomentum.

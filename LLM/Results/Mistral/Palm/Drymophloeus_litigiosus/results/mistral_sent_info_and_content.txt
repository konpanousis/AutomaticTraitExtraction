We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Drymophloeus litigiosus.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:

Plants may flower at a small size.

Description: Drymophloeus litigiosus is a small to medium-sized palm clustering with small crown, reaching up to 5 m. tall, It is popular for its attractive foliage.
Small to moderate, solitary pinnate-leaved palms, native to Moluccas, New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, Solomon Islands and Samoa, with crownshaft and praemorse leaflets, elongate peduncles and seed rounded in cross section, the endosperm can be ruminate or homogeneous.
Rank: FLOWERING.
Germination adjacent-ligular, eophyll bifid, or entire, ovate, margins toothed.
Back to Arecaceae index.
It is indeed quite variable and like most understory palms, individuals of these species vary in terms of leaf size, width and texture, even when the floral and fruit characters are uniform.
Pistillate flowers broadly ovoid, sepals 3, distinct, imbricate, hooded, edges minutely toothed or variously notched, petals 3, twice as long as the sepals in late bud, distinct, ovate, imbricate, lateral margins shortly fringed, tips thick, valvate, staminodes 3, shortly joined basally, wide, truncate and bifid or uneven distally, gynoecium symmetrical, ovoid, tapering distally, unilocular, uniovulate, stigmas 3, recurved, ovule attached laterally or pendulous from the top of the locule, form unknown.
Crown: Up to 1,8 m in diameter, with 5 to 7 leaves.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.
Seed: The endosperm of the seed is ruminate.
A medium-sized palm clustering, reaching up to 5 m. tall, with broad, dark green, leaflets, with premorse leaf tips, and white flowers.
It is clearly different from the rest, twice the growth rate, 50% larger trunk, petioles to 8', and leaves nearly 6' in diameter.
Areca litoralis Blume, Rumphia 2: 123 , not validly publ.
Seed ovoid, surface smooth, hilum apical, raphe much branched, branches somewhat sunken, endosperm homogeneous or ruminate, embryo basal.
.Mama tree is a stud at nearly 16' with a 6' leaf, hard to photograph up in the secondary canopy.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

Stems generally bear spines on the internodes, in B. glaucescens and B. setulosa spines are also present on the nodes.
Individuals can grow to 6 m.
They have simple or pinnately compound leaves and yellow, orange, red or purple-black fruit.
Ripe fruit can be yellow, orange, red or purple-black and range from 0.5-4.5 centimetres long. : 5-11.
The leaves can be either pinnately compound or simple, in some species like B. hirta both types of leaves exist.
Most species are small trees about 2 m tall, but some are large trees while others are shrubs with subterranean stems.
Leaves 4-9, leaf spines scattered, black, terete, to 6 cm long, dense on lateral surfaces of sheath and petiole, fewer on abaxial surface of rachis, sheath 22-54 cm long, sheath, petiole, and rachis whitish brown-tomentose, ocrea not seen, petiole 20-27 cm long, rachis 65-135 cm long, pinnae 4-14 per side, irregularly arranged in clusters, spreading in different planes, concave, glabrous, thick and leathery, strongly plicate, with prominent veins adaxially, middle pinnae 45-87 x 3.5-5.5 cm , blade occasionally simple, bifid, 90-110 cm long, 22-36 cm wide at apex of rachis.
All species have spiny leaves, the spines are often clustered on the petiole or rachis.
In some species the spines are only found on the tips of the leaflets. : 4-5  Most species grow in multi-stemmed clumps with stems about 2 metres tall and 3 centimetres in diameter, but they span a range of sizes from tall trees to shrubs with subterranean stems and are sometimes single-stemmed.
Stems can be as narrow as 0.3-0.5 centimetres in B.aubletiana or as broad as 25 centimetres in B. gasipaes.
Flowers grow in triplets along the inflorescence, each female flower is flanked by two male flowers, elsewhere along the inflorescence male flowers grow singly or in pairs.
Petioles range from 5 centimetres to over 1.5 metres in length, while the rachis can be 3 centimetres to over 3 metres long. : 4-5  Inflorescences are borne singly emerging from the leaf axil.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.
Stems cespitose, in tight clumps of 4-6 stems, 2-6 m tall, to 5 cm diam., usually spiny on internodes.

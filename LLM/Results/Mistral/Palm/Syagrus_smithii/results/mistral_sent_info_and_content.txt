We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Syagrus smithii.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Cupule enlargement amount in fruit.
Leaflet arrangement along the rachis.
They are monoecious , with both male and female flowers borne in the same inflorescence.

x lacerdamourae , occasionally shows second-order branching, and emerge from between the leaves.
Butia stolonifera was an oddly growing palm assigned to the genus Butia found only once in Uruguay in the 19th century, but which now is considered to be uncertain as a valid species.
Geonoma is a genus of small to medium-sized palms native to the forest understorey of tropical Central and South America.
The palm has a small stature, only growing to a height of 6 feet.

Petal length in mature fruit cupule.
Seed free or adhering to pericarp.
Those species that have upright trunks grow 2–36 metres tall with stems that are 6–35 centimetres in diameter.
The transition from the leaf sheath to the petiole can be gradual and difficult to identify, but in species where they can be distinguished, leaf sheaths are 2.5–180   cm long and the petioles are 0–30   cm.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Ravenea louvelii.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Fruit 1-3 seeded globose to ellipsoid when 1-seeded, slightly lobed when more than 1 seed develops, yellow, orange or red, more rarely brown, purple or black, stigmatic remains subbasal, lateral, or subapical, epicarp smooth or minutely pebbled, mesocarp fleshy, endocarp thin.
Staminate flowers ± symmetrical, sepals 3, triangular, connate in the basal 1/3, adnate to the floral stalk, to the base of the stamen filaments and to the petal bases, petals 3, broadly ovate, distinct or rarely connate basally, fleshy, stamens 6, sometimes inserted in 2 series, filaments slender, short, basally expanded, shortly adnate to sepals and petals, rarely connate in an androecial ring, anthers straight or somewhat twisted, ± sagittate, latrorse.
This is one of the strangest Ravenea species, with an archaic appearance.
Stem erect, rarely very short, very rarely branching dichotomously, often tall, becoming bare, sometimes swollen at the base, conspicuously ringed with leaf scars or not.
The leaves are up to 2-5 m long, pinnately compound, reduplicate, erect at first then arching, twisted near the apex, with numerous crowded narrow ribbed leaflets.
Very neat narrow stiff leaflets.
It is a very large palm with a large, untidy crown.
Short, stocky, palm of the forest undergrowth.
Trees grow from 1.5–8 meters in height, and 13–30 cm in diameter.
They are small to large, dioecious palms, with solitary, robust grey stems, swollen at base and gradually tapering upward.
Inflorescence partly hidden among leaves.
Seeds, globose, hemispherical or representing a third of a sphere, hilum basal, raphe branches indistinct, endosperm homogeneous, embryo basal.
Solitary, slender to robust, unarmed, dioecious, pleonanthic palms.
Dioecious pinnate-leaved palms of Madagascar and the Comores, distinguishable by the combination of incomplete prophyll, staminodes bearing rudimentary anthers and the fruit with subapical or apical stigmatic remains.
Flowers more crowded and somewhat grouped distally, congenitally open.
Vegetative , root and floral.
The inflorescence is short, borne among the leaves, the fruit is a red drupe.
The base of each frond is green, yet they become white to dark grey near the tip at maturity.
A short, litter collecting palm of the understory, to about 3m tall,.with leaves up to 4m.
Leaves. pinnate with two or more leaflets.
Pistillate flowers with sepals and petals similar to staminate, staminodes 6, broadly triangular with sterile anthers, gynoecium ovoid, tricarpellate, carpels connate, trilocular, triovulate, stigmas 3, fleshy, recurved, ovules pendulous, hemianatropous.
It has symmetrical leaves and develops an attractive swollen base of the trunk.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

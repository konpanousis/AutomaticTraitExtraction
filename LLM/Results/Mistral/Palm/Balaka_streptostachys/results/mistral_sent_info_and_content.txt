We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Balaka streptostachys.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Fruit irregularly ovoid, tapered toward the apex, 18-25 x 8-14 mm wide, orange-red at maturity, stigmatic remains apical on a beaked cone, epicarp smooth, drying moderately granular, mesocarp 2-3 mm thick, fibrous, endocarp longitudinally ridged, four-angled in cross section, apex with a moderate beaked extension, surface with numerous irregular shallow channels, seed similarly shaped as endocarp, hilum longitudinal, endosperm homogeneous, embryo basal.
Pollen elliptical in polar view, long axis ca.
The inflorescence is distinctive in that the rachillae are densely tomentose, have 40Ë-60Ë twists at intermittent intervals, and are angular in cross-section.
Pollen elliptical in polar view, long axis about 36 pm, short axis about 15 pm, monosulcate, exine tectate, finely reticulate.
Flowers in triads for entire length ofthe rachilla, staminate flowers bullet-shaped in bud, 6-7 mm long, symmetrical, white, sepals triangular, 3 mm long, margins smooth, petals eiongare, 6 mm long, 2-3 mm wide, apically pointed, thick, apically valvate, stamens 20-35, filaments thin 3-4 mm long, anthers linear, 4 mm long, dorsifixed, versatile, pistillode elongate, 4-5 mm long, flask-shaped.
Mature fruits are orange-red and 2 cm long.
Flowers in triads for entire length ofthe rachilla, staminate flowers bullet-shaped in bud, 6-7 mm long, symmetrical, white, sepals triangular, 3 mm long, margins smooth, petals eiongare, 6 mm long, 2-3 mm wide, apically pointed, thick, apically valvate, stamens 20-35, filaments thino 3-4 mm long, anthers linear, 4 mm long, dorsifixed, versatile, pistillode elongate, 4-5 mm long, flask-shaped.
It grows to a height of 4 to 7 metres and 10 centimetres in diameter.
Pinnae in one plane, regularly arranged,.
This is the stoutest of the Balaka with a trunk of up to 100mm or 4 inches thickness that is double the others." , edric.
This is the most solid looking of the Balaka species with a trunk of about 10 cm.with obvious nodes and an overall height of 5 to 7 meters when mature.
Most palms hold about 9 fronds of 3 meters with old fronds persisting.to hang down the trunk.
Pinnae in one plane, regularly arranged, sub-opposite, 18-22 per side, obliquely truncate at the apex, apically dentate, mid-leaf pinnae elongately falcate, 83-95 x 6-8 cm wide, tapered from the middle toward the apex and the base, basal pinnae 90-110 x 6-7 cm wide, distal pinnae increasingly elongate to compactly cuneate toward the leaf apex, apical pair basally joined for one-sixth to one-fourth their length, mid rib prominent on both sides in all pinnae, secondary ribs almost as prominent abaxially only, two to six each side of pinna, marginal veins thick, lower marginal vein tomentose.
The endocarp and seed are ridged and angular as with other Balaka species, though the arrangement with a single prominent longitudinal ridge, extended "wings" and quadrangular in cross-section is distinctive.
Inflorescentia usque ad 1.5 m longa.
Solitary palm, trunk erect, 4-7 m tall, dbh 7-10 cm, base not expanded, internodes congested, dark green to grey with age, nodes conspicuous, light green-brown.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.



Here is the JSON format of the dictionary with the sublists of (value, evidence) for each trait:

Note: I have set the binary flag 'b' to 1 for the following associations:

* Fruit colour description: "red"
* Fruit colour: "orange", "red"
* Fruit shape: "ovoid"

All other associations have been set to 0, as there was no strong evidence for them in the input text, or they did not match the given trait.

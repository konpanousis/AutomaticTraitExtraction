Pollen elliptical in polar view, long axis ca.
The inflorescence is distinctive in that the rachillae are densely tomentose, have 40Ë-60Ë twists at intermittent intervals, and are angular in cross-section.
Pollen elliptical in polar view, long axis about 36 pm, short axis about 15 pm, monosulcate, exine tectate, finely reticulate.
Flowers in triads for entire length ofthe rachilla, staminate flowers bullet-shaped in bud, 6-7 mm long, symmetrical, white, sepals triangular, 3 mm long, margins smooth, petals eiongare, 6 mm long, 2-3 mm wide, apically pointed, thick, apically valvate, stamens 20-35, filaments thin 3-4 mm long, anthers linear, 4 mm long, dorsifixed, versatile, pistillode elongate, 4-5 mm long, flask-shaped.
Mature fruits are orange-red and 2 cm long.

It grows to a height of 4 to 7 metres and 10 centimetres in diameter.
Pinnae in one plane, regularly arranged,.
This is the stoutest of the Balaka with a trunk of up to 100mm or 4 inches thickness that is double the others." , edric.
This is the most solid looking of the Balaka species with a trunk of about 10 cm.with obvious nodes and an overall height of 5 to 7 meters when mature.
Most palms hold about 9 fronds of 3 meters with old fronds persisting.to hang down the trunk.
Pinnae in one plane, regularly arranged, sub-opposite, 18-22 per side, obliquely truncate at the apex, apically dentate, mid-leaf pinnae elongately falcate, 83-95 x 6-8 cm wide, tapered from the middle toward the apex and the base, basal pinnae 90-110 x 6-7 cm wide, distal pinnae increasingly elongate to compactly cuneate toward the leaf apex, apical pair basally joined for one-sixth to one-fourth their length, mid rib prominent on both sides in all pinnae, secondary ribs almost as prominent abaxially only, two to six each side of pinna, marginal veins thick, lower marginal vein tomentose.
The endocarp and seed are ridged and angular as with other Balaka species, though the arrangement with a single prominent longitudinal ridge, extended "wings" and quadrangular in cross-section is distinctive.
Inflorescentia usque ad 1.5 m longa.
Solitary palm, trunk erect, 4-7 m tall, dbh 7-10 cm, base not expanded, internodes congested, dark green to grey with age, nodes conspicuous, light green-brown.

Fl. cream, Mar to Jul or Sep. Lateritic loam.
Flowers small to very small, usually cream-coloured, calyx with receptacle often producing a short, broad stalk, tubular above, tipped with 3 triangular lobes, these sometimes imbricate at the very base, glabrous or hairy, corolla shallow, tubular at the base, apically with 3 triangular, valvate lobes, stamens 6, epipetalous, the filaments connate to form a fleshy ring, tipped with short, slender distinct filaments, anthers medifixed, rounded or oblong, latrorse, gynoecium tricarpellate, the carpels wedge-shaped, distinct in the ovarian region, connate distally to form a common, slender style, with an apical, dot-like or minutely 3-lobed stigma, ovule basally attached, anatropous, where dioecious, anthers or ovules not developing but otherwise as in the hermaphroditic.
The panicles of yellow flowers are the same length.
Exceptionally tall plants of 21 m and 10.4 in may be about 720 years and 360 years old respectively.
Fruit usually developing from 1 carpel, globose to ovoid, pyriform, or ellipsoidal, small to medium-sized, variously coloured, green, scarlet, blue-green, blue-black, black or dark brown, stigmatic remains apical, sterile carpel remains basal, epicarp smooth, dull or shining, often with a wax bloom, mesocarp thin or thick, fleshy or dry, somewhat fibrous, usually easily separated from the bony or woody endocarp.
Individuals can grow to 12 m.
Tree-like monocot , 8-10 m high.
Usually tall, single-stemmed fan-palms of the Horn of Africa and Arabia, and Himalayas to Australia, there are a few dwarf species, most are hermaphroditic but a few dioecious species are known.
Stem erect, obscured at first by persistent sheaths, later becoming bare or covered with persistent petiole bases, conspicuously or obscurely ringed with leaf scars.
Trunk to 15 m tall, 10-15 cm in diameter, breast high, leaf scars raised, internodes narrow, grey, leaf-bases often persistent.
True Livistona chinensis in the wild easily and quickly grows to 15 meters and has a thick trunk 40-50 centimeters in diameter.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.
It is thickened at the bottom and covered with the remains of fallen leaves.
Fruit obovoid, infrequently approaching ellipsoid, 12-16 mm long, 8-9 mm in diam., glossy purple-black, epicarp smooth, pedicel 0.5-2 mm long.
Flowers solitary or in clusters of 2-4, 1.6-1.9 mm long, campanulate, cream to yellow, sepals broadly ovate, 0.2-1 mm long, fleshy, acute, petals narrowly ovate, 0.5-1.9 mm long, thick, acute, stamens ca 1.5 mm long.
The leaves may also turn yellow due to underwatering.
Slender to robust, solitary, armed or unarmed, pleonanthic, hermaphroditic , shrub or tree palms.
Germination remote-tubular, eophyll lanceolate, plicate, minutely toothed apically.
Fruit obovoid, infrequently approaching ellipsoid, 12-16 mm long, 8-9 mm diam., glossy purple-black, epicarp smooth, pedicel 0.5-2 mm long.
Leaves palmate or costapalmate, petiole unarmed or armed with spines, blade divided to varying depths into single-fold induplicate segments, filaments sometimes present at the sinuses.
In indoor cultivation, the plant flowers infrequently by producing inflorescences 120-130 centimeters long and later clusters of round brown berries.
Ovary of 3 free carpels that are united above to form a single slender style with apical stigma, ovule basal.
It produces inflorescences up to 120 centimeters long.
The petioles are 1.5-2 meters long, with frequent, strong sharp thorns at the edges, the thorns are brown, even almost black, which makes them clearly visible.
Fruit usually developing from 1 carpel, stigmatic remains apical, epicarp smooth, mesocarp thin or thick, usually easily separated from the stony endocarp.

There are 8 to 40 stamens present.
Rarely is there a second bract.
They are shorter than, or equally long as the leaves.
The stylus is solid, the scars are bent back to blossom.
.The leaves are pinnate, bifid or completely divided.
Definitie: whole plant growth form.
The Stamindoen they fused at the base and fused with the petals very short or up to half of the petals.
The pollen is ellipsoidal or flattened triangular, and from mild to significant asymmetry.
Germination adjacent-ligular, eophyll simple or bifid.
Fruit 1-seeded, black, borne on the enlarged reddish-tinged rachillae, usually ovoid or ellipsoidal, stigmatic remains apical, epicarp smooth, mesocarp fleshy with 2 layers of flattish longitudinal fibres, endocarp thin, fragile.
The inflorescence axis running in a simple ear off , or it bears at the top a few, forced standing Rachillae.These are long, protrude beyond the inflorescence axis, and are in the armpit of narrow, triangular bracts.
The three sepals are free imbricat, blunt and concave.
The upper half is spread to blossom.
The petiole is well developed, concave or flat on the top, at the bottom of rounded or angular.
They are single-stemmed or clump -forming, non-reinforced, monoecious and repeatedly flowering.
The ovules about putting something on the base, their form is not known.Fruit
The internodes are very short to moderately long, the leaf scars on the trunk are striking.
The three petals are two to three times as long as the sepals, valvat and grown very short at the base.
The gynoecium is ovoid or ellipsoidal,
Seed ovoid or ellipsoidal, basally or laterally attached, usually furrowed by sparse vascular strands, raphe superficial or impressed, endosperm homogeneous or ruminate, embryo basal.
The three petals project beyond the sepals.
The exocarp is smooth, the mesocarp is fleshy with two layers of flat longitudinal fibers,.endocarp is thin and fragile.
In the distal region of the Rachillae, individual or paired male flowers are located instead of the triads.
The peduncle is very slim to medium strong and growing even after flowering or in the length.
Definitie: An autotroph which is capable of transforming light into chemical energy.
This is Roehrig or not, oblong, securities and initially enclosed by the cover sheet, later released by the growth of the stem and disintegrating.

The edge of the petiole may be winged.
Sometimes form in the leaf blade window, so the leaves dry up on the plant or fall off under their own weight.
The filaments are short, slender, short fused at the base and connected to the base of the petals.

Stems cespitose, 1.5-3.5 m tall, 2.2-3 cm diam., usually spiny on internodes.
Occurring commonly.with or near B. militaris, and some.individuals appearing intermediate.
In some species the spines are only found on the tips of the leaflets. : 4-5  Most species grow in multi-stemmed clumps with stems about 2 metres tall and 3 centimetres in diameter, but they span a range of sizes from tall trees to shrubs with subterranean stems and are sometimes single-stemmed.
Similar to Bactris militaris, but has smaller leaves, and purportedly, there is a solitary trunk form.

Stems generally bear spines on the internodes, in B. glaucescens and B. setulosa spines are also present on the nodes.
It may occur sympatrically with Bactris neomilitaris, which it resembles in its usually simple leaves, but these are ovate, shorter and wider, and do not have parallel margins.

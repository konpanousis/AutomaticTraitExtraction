We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Bactris grayumii.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Similar to Bactris militaris but smaller leaves and supposedly solitary trunked.
An attractive, small, spiny palm with either sparsely pinnate or undivided leaves.
Spacing: 6-8 ft. 8-10 ft.
Stems can be as narrow as 0.3-0.5 centimetres in B.aubletiana or as broad as 25 centimetres in B. gasipaes.
Leaves 4-9 per crown, leaf spines scattered, black, terete, to 6 cm long, few on sheath, petiole, and abaxial surface of rachis, sheath 20-29 cm long, ocrea not seen, petiole 40-45 cm long, rachis 29-70 cm long, blade usually simple and deeply bifid, concave, thick and leathery, strongly plicate, with prominent veins adaxially, occasionally irregularly pinnate, blade to 1 m long, 36-38 cm wide at apex of rachis, when regular pinnate the pinnae 55-90 x 2.5-10 cm.
They have simple or pinnately compound leaves and yellow, orange, red or purple-black fruit.
Ripe fruit can be yellow, orange, red or purple-black and range from 0.5-4.5 centimetres long. : 5-11.
All species have spiny leaves, the spines are often clustered on the petiole or rachis.
Beautiful simple leaf palm with long, narrow, unsplit leaves up to 10' long that shoot right out of the ground.
Flowers grow in triplets along the inflorescence, each female flower is flanked by two male flowers, elsewhere along the inflorescence male flowers grow singly or in pairs.
Leaves 4-9, leaf spines scattered, black, terete, to 6 cm long, few on sheath, petiole, and abaxial surface of rachis, sheath 20-29 cm long, ocrea not seen, petiole 40-45 cm long, rachis 29-70 cm long, blade usually simple and deeply bifid, cOncave, thick and leathery, strongly plicate, with prominent veins adaxially, occasionally irregularly pinnate, blade to 1 m long, 36-38 cm wide at apex of rachis, when pinnate the pinnae 55-90 x 2.5-10 cm.
The leaves can be either pinnately compound or simple, in some species like B. hirta both types of leaves exist.
Stems cespitose, 1.5-3.5 m tall, 2.2-3 cm diam., usually spiny on internodes.
Occurring commonly.with or near B. militaris, and some.individuals appearing intermediate.
In some species the spines are only found on the tips of the leaflets. : 4-5  Most species grow in multi-stemmed clumps with stems about 2 metres tall and 3 centimetres in diameter, but they span a range of sizes from tall trees to shrubs with subterranean stems and are sometimes single-stemmed.
Similar to Bactris militaris, but has smaller leaves, and purportedly, there is a solitary trunk form.
Petioles range from 5 centimetres to over 1.5 metres in length, while the rachis can be 3 centimetres to over 3 metres long. : 4-5  Inflorescences are borne singly emerging from the leaf axil.
Or clustering, caespitose , 1.5-3.5 m tall, 2.2-3 cm in diam., usually spiny on internodes.
Light Shade Foliage: Grown for foliage Evergreen Foliage Color: Unknown - Tell us Height: 10-12 ft. 12-15 ft.
Stems generally bear spines on the internodes, in B. glaucescens and B. setulosa spines are also present on the nodes.
It may occur sympatrically with Bactris neomilitaris, which it resembles in its usually simple leaves, but these are ovate, shorter and wider, and do not have parallel margins.
Colonial palm to 3 m tall.
Most species are small trees about 2 m tall, but some are large trees while others are shrubs with subterranean stems.
An attractive, small, solitary, spiny palm with either.sparsely pinnate or undivided leaves.
Sparingly colonial palm in primary.forest understory, the trunks to ca.3 m. Spines blackish.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Chamaedorea klotzschiana.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The flowers are produced in inflorescences , they are dioecious , with male and female flowers on separate plants.
Flowers seem to arise from below ground level and plants only 3' tall have large upright flowers nearly as tall as the entire plant.
Germination adjacent-ligular, eophyll bifid or pinnate.

Clustering, moderately slender palm to c. 6 m tall, bearing 7 - 10 leaves per crown.
Clustering or solitary palm, leaflets usually irregularly arranged, with a group of closely spaced single- or bi-fold leaflets in the middle of the leaf rachis, or leaflets regularly arranged with the basal leaflets being truncately praemorse apically and inserted onto a rachis that extends into a well-defined petiole. 4.
Seeds globose, endosperm shallowly ruminate.

This apparently obligate rheophyte is distinguished by its pliable, mostly leaning stems, and soft, flexible leaves.
Seeds 5 - 7 x 5 - 6.2 mm, globose to ovoid, hilum lateral, elongate, endosperm homogeneous or ± ruminate.
The staminate flowers are larger than the pistillate flowers and have lanceolate, valvate petals that vary slightly in size.
Stem 2-4 cm in diam.
The leaves are pinnate and widely varied.

Fruits 7 - 9 x 6 - 8 mm when ripe, globose to ovoid, smooth and drying wrinkled or ridged, perianth appressed to the fruit, pericarp c. 0.8 - 1.2 mm thick, epicarp orange, purple or various shades of red.
C. Inflorescences with pistillate flowers.
Clustering or solitary palm, stem rigid and usually erect, leaflets linear or cuneate, relatively stiff and papery, terminal leaflets comprising 3 - 16 folds , basal leaflets pointed, obliquely praemorse or truncately praemorse apically, may occur on stream banks, but not restricted to this habitat. 2.
The trunks may be solitary or suckering and may be diminutive to robust, spanning a range of heights.
Stem 1.5 - 3.8 cm in diam., smooth and dark with blotches, internodes c. 2 - 10 cm long.
Fruits c. 7 mm long, globose to broadly ellipsoid, smooth to shallowly ridged.
Seeds 5.1 - 7.2 x 5 - 6.8 mm, globose to subglobose, hilum lateral, elongate, endosperm ruminate.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.
D. Infructescence with immature fruit.
Definitie: An autotroph which is capable of transforming light into chemical energy.
Stem 2 - 10 cm in diam., smooth, with grey, brown and green blotches, internodes 2 - 25 cm long.
Notes:-Hydriastele variabilis is a slender understorey to midstorey palm bearing leaves with regularly to.subregularly arranged, linear leaflets.
Fruits 10 - 12 x 6.3 - 7.8 mm when ripe, ellipsoid to ovoid with ends tapering when dry, smooth, drying ridged, perianth appressed to the fruit, pericarp c. 0.8 mm thick, epicarp red.
Clustering, slender palm with up to 30 stems per clump, 4 - 6 m tall, bearing 4 - 12 leaves per crown.
Stem 4.5 - 6 cm in diam., smooth and dark with lighter blotches, internodes 9 - 25 cm long.
A leaf apex, B mid-leaf portion, C leaf base, D leaf sheaths above attached inflorescences with or without prophyll, E infructescence, F staminate flower whole and in longitudinal section, G pistillate flower whole, two views, and in longitudinal section, H portion of rachilla with fruits, J fruit in longitudinal section.
Solitary or clustering, slender palm with 5 - 15 stems per clump, 2 - 6 m tall, bearing 6 - 8 leaves per crown.
Solitary or clustering, slender to moderate palm with 3 - 10 stems per clump, 1 - 17 m tall, bearing 5 - 10 leaves per crown.
It is distinguished by its petiolate leaves with 12 - 30 pairs of often irregularly arranged leaflets, the basal ones of which are truncately praemorse, and leaf sheaths of 40 - 73 cm in length.
The infructescence.is rather distinctive in being branched to one or two orders, and bearing fruits that become somewhat fusiform upon.drying.
These ultimate inflorescence axes are inserted closely together and are swept forward giving the inflorescence a horsetail-like appearance.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Chamaedorea pygmaea.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The flowers are produced in inflorescences , they are dioecious , with male and female flowers on separate plants.
The fruit is an orange or red drupe 0.5-2 cm diameter.
Stem: 1-2 cm diam., creeping at or below ground or leaflitter and attaining 30-40 cm in length, green, densely ringed, internodes to 5 mm long, often covered with persistent leaf sheaths.
Pistillate flower with sepals 3, as in the staminate, petals 3, usually connate, distinct lobes valvate or imbricate, staminodes present and tooth-like or absent, gynoecium ovoid, tricarpellate, syncarpous, trilocular, trilovulate, stigmas small, recurved, ovule campylotropous, laterally inserted.
Pistillate spicate or forked, rachis or flower-bearing portion 10 cm long, curved, pale greenish in flower, orange and swollen in fruit.
Leaf , root , seed.
Fruits: 6-8 mm long, ± oblong, black, eophyll pinnate.
General Information Plant practically acaulescent, 60-80 cm.
Definition: plant which has no persistent woody stem above ground.
Flowers: Staminate remotely arranged, green, fragrant, sessile, Calyx 1x 1.5 mm, shallowly lobed, sepals connate in basal 3/4, rounded apically, petals 3 mm long, oblong-obovate, valvate, free nearly to base, broadly obtuse or nearly rotund to acute, fleshy.
Inflorescences among or below the leaves, solitary or several per leaf axil, unbranched or branched to 1 order, sometimes forked, staminate often more branched than pistillate, peduncle short to elongate, prophyll tubular with tapering bifid tip, peduncular bracts 2-several, elongate, tubular, sheathing the peduncle, coriaceous or membranous, persistent, tips short, bifid, rachillae, long or short, slender or fleshy, sometimes ridged, lacking bracts at maturity, bearing closely appressed or rather widely spaced, spirally arranged staminate or pistillate flowers, rarely bearing curved acervuli of staminate flowers.
Herb, Solitary palm.
Some features of floral anatomy, including vascularisation of the ovule by a strand from each ventral bundle and abundant raphides in styles and stigmas, are characteristic of other genera in Chamaedoreeae and Ceroxyleae.
Germination adjacent-ligular, eophyll bifid or pinnate.
Habit: solitary, erect or decumbent, appearing stemless, to 60 cm tall.
Pistillate fairly densely arranged, green, calyx lobed, sepals bluntly rounded apically, petals elongated, short-pointed, imbricate basally, spreading apically, staminodes 6, broadly uniform, pistil depressed-globose, 3-lobed, stigma lobes sessile, recurved slightly.
Generally rather small, often clustering, pinnate-leaved dioecious palms from the undergrowth of rain forest from Mexico southwards to South America, very diverse and with a wide range of habits including one climbing species, inflorescence and flower form equally varied.
Leaves: 3-8, erect-spreading, pinnate, variously pinnate or occasionally bifid, sheath 5-10 cm long, long-open, splitting deeply opposite petiole and tubular only near base, green with brownish margin, ageing brown and persisting, densely striated, petiole 5-25 cm long, slender, lightly grooved especially near base and green above, rounded and greenish below, rachis 12-16 cm long, angled and green above, rounded and green below, pinnae usually 9-12 on each side of rachis, 12-15 x 1-2.5 cm, lanceolate or elongate-lanceolate, long-attenuate, falcate, thin, lower margins briefly decurrent on rachis, upper pinnae wider and not decreasing noticeably in length toward apex of rachis, weakly toothed, a prominent midrib and one primary nerve conspicuous on each side of this above, if bifid, blade 20-30 x 6-15 cm, cuneate-obovate, incised apically to 1/3 its length, lobes long, thin, narrowly acuminate, narrowed basally, olive-green above in dried state, paler below, 12-14 prominent nerves on each side of rachis, 2 secondary nerves conspicuous below between each pair of primaries, tertiaries numerous and less conspicuous, or blade variously pinnate with a broad terminal pair and several basal pinnae, lower margin of lowest pinnae obscurely decurrent along petiole to sheath.
Fruit small, globose or oblong, stigmatic remains basal, epicarp smooth, mesocarp fleshy, endocarp thin.
Individuals can grow to 0.75 m.
Staminate flowers symmetrical, sepals 3, entire, united basally or distinct, petals 3, distinct or variously connate, lobes valvate, stamens 6, filaments short, broad or awl-shaped, anthers dorsifixed, included, oblong or didymous, pistillode various, cylindric or expanded basally, sometimes trilobed.
Inflorescences: inter- or infrafoliar, erect-ascending, arising from base, long-pedunculate, shorter than or about equalling leaves, peduncles to 20 cm long, erect, bracts 4-8, to 15 cm long, narrowly tubular, 3 mm wide, membranous, bifid, longitudinally striate-nerved, brown in flower, Staminate with rachis to 10 cm long, slender, straight, greenish in flower, rachillae 10-25, these to 6-8 cm long, longest near base and becoming progressively shorter toward apex of rachis, slender, widely spreading or ± recurved or drooping, flexuous, greenish in flower.
Seed erect, globose, or ellipsoidal, hilum small, basal, branches of raphe obscure, endosperm cartilaginous, embryo basal to subapical.
The leaves are pinnate , with one to numerous leaflets.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.
Stem usually slender, covered wholly or partially in fibrous leaf bases or smooth, green, prominently ringed with leaf scars.
Leaves bifid or variously pinnate, very rarely entire, reduplicate, sheath closed or becoming split, short or elongate, sometimes with a marcescent lobe opposite the petiole, petiole short to elongate, flattened adaxially, rounded abaxially, sometimes with a prominent pale green or yellow, abaxial stripe, rachis rounded, angled, or flattened adaxially, rounded abaxially, blade entire, bifid and pinnately ribbed, or regularly or irregularly pinnately divided, leaflets few or many, of 1 or several folds, narrow or broad, often oblique or sigmoid, acuminate, surfaces glabrous.
Flowers sessile or partly enclosed in a cavity in the fleshy rachilla, small or minute.
Small, sometimes moderate, erect or procumbent, rarely climbing, acaulescent or trunked, solitary or clustered, unarmed, pleonanthic, dioecious palms.
They are small palms, growing to 0.3-6 m tall with slender, cane-like stems, growing in the understory in rainforests , and often spreading by means of underground runners , forming clonal colonies.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

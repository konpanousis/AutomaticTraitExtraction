We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Dypsis perrieri.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Many Dypsis species have aerial branching , a rare growth habit among palms.
A massive, stocky, litter collecting palm, to about 8m tall,.with erect leaves.
Inflorescencebranchingorder. 2, 3.
Staminate flowers symmetrical, ± rounded to bullet-shaped, sometimes very small, sepals imbricate, petals valvate, basally briefly connate, stamens 3 or 6 , 3 staminodes sometimes present, these either antesepalous or antepetalous, very rarely adnate to the pistillode, pistillode present or absent.
A complex and highly variable genus of pinnate-leaved palms that has radiated spectacularly in Madagascar and Comores, with an outlier on Pemba off the coast of Tanzania, the genus includes towering forest giants, bottle palms, litter-trappers, stemless palms, some of the most slender of all palms, and even two climbing members, all have fruit with basal stigmatic remains.
Not hairy at all.
Leaves sometimes in 3 ranks, neatly abscissing, leaving conspicuous leaf-scars, leaflets numerous, often curved, single-fold.
Very small to very large unarmed pleonanthic monoecious palms.
Leaf , root and floral.
Rank: FLOWERING.
Trunk with dead leaves and persistent leaf sheath bases.
Fruit usually ellipsoidal, drupaceous, generally rather small, with stigmatic remains at one side near the base, epicarp smooth, outer mesocarp thin, fleshy, inner mesocarp reticulate fibrous, endocarp very thin.
Female flowers eventually larger than the â, sepals 3, free, imbricate, petals 3, free, imbricate, pistil with stigmas 3, closely adpressed in bud, spreading at anthesis, and 1 locule with 1 ovule.
Solitary or clustered, moderate, unarmed, occasionally aerially branching, reduplicately pinnate, pleonanthic, monoecious palms, with or without well-defined crown-shafts.
Germination adjacent-ligular, seedling leaf bifid.
Massive, squat solitary palm.
Seed basally attached, slightly grooved longitudinally, endosperm homogeneous, embryo lateral or sub-basal.
They are slender, evergreen palms with yellow flowers carried in panicles amongst the pinnate leaves.
Fruit borne with persistent calyx and corolla,spherical, ellipsoid, fusiform or rarely curved, stigmatic remains basal,often obscured by perianth, epicarp often brightly coloured or jet blackor rarely dull green or brown, mesocarp thin, fleshy or fibrous, endocarpusually thin, fibrous.
Leaves. pinnate with two or more leaflets.
Base of crown litter-accu-mulating.
Male flowers symmetrical, sepals 3, free, imbricate, petals 3, free, valvate, stamens 6, anthers ± versatile, pistillode conical to columnar.
Pistillate flowers about the same size as the staminate, sepalsrounded, broadly imbricate, petals imbricate with triangular valvate tips,staminodes usually present, minute, tooth-like, usually 3 or 6 at one sideof the ovary, pistil pseudomonomerous, often strongly asymmetrical, stigmas 3, apical, sometimes eccentric,ovule form unknown.
Stems solitary or clustered, very short, subterranean, creeping-rhizomatous, erect, in one species climbing, sometimes branched aerially by apparent dichotomy.
Massive, stocky, litter-trapping palm, to 8 m tall.
Trunk with marcescent leaves and persistent bases of leaf sheaths, internodes c. 4 cm, nodal scars dotted with fibre remains, c. 2 cm wide.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

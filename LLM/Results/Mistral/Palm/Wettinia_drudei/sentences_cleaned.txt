They have a low, dense cone of brown or black stilt roots , and pinnate leaves.
Pistillate flowers open in bud asymmetrical due to close packing, usually borne with 2 vestigial staminate flowers, sepals 3, imbricate, or separated, or briefly connate basally, deltoid to elongate triangular, petals 3, similar to but usually longer and broader than the sepals, staminodes 6, minute, tooth-like or absent, gynoecium of 1-3 minutely roughened, hairy or bristly fertile carpels and 2 abortive carpels, with basal or apical, short to elongate, glabrous or hairy style, and 3 elongate, large stigmas, persistent or deciduous in fruit, ovule laterally attached at the base, anatropous.
Staminate flowers crowded in ebracteolate pairs or solitary, open within the inflorescence bud, sepals 3, briefly connate or distinct, ± narrow-triangular, small, petals much longer than the sepals, 3, narrow triangular, straight or hooked at the apex, briefly valvate at the base, stamens 6-20, filaments short, slender, anthers basifixed, erect, elongate, latrorse, pistillode absent or minute and trifid.
The rope-like inflorescences of the plant emerge from leathery spathes , and grow in a circular pattern around one or more trunk rings beneath the crown shaft.
Usually moderate solitary or clustered pinnate-leaved tree palms of the Andes and foothills, the stems with stilt roots, leaflets are rhomboid praemorse, and sometimes longitudinally divided to give the whole leaf an ostrich-feather appearance, inflorescences are often multiple at each node, often unisexual, and the fruit has basal stigmatic remains and embryo.
Stem solitary, 3-7 m tall and 2-4 cm in diameter, smooth.
Male flowers up to 27 mm long, with 5-6 stamens.
Leaves few in number, spirally arranged or rarely distichous, pinnate, neatly abscising or rarely marcescent, sheaths forming a well-defined crownshaft, covered with a variety of indumentum types, petiole rather short, adaxially channelled or convex, abaxially rounded, rachis adaxially angled, abaxially rounded, bearing hairs of various types, leaflets of two sorts, one undivided, elongate, asymmetrically and narrowly elliptic in outline, the proximal margin entire for ca.
Shrub, Caespitose palm.
Stem erect, conspicuously ringed with leaf scars, bearing at the base a cone of stilt roots, covered in small sharp lateral roots.
Palms of the genus Wettinia are monoecious , medium-sized to large, and typically solitary-trunked.
Flowers white or cream-coloured at anthesis, densely crowded.

Seed ellipsoidal or subglobose, sometimes enclosed in a gelatinous mass when fresh, basally attached with rounded hilum, raphe elongate with reticulate branches, endosperm homogeneous or ruminate, embryo basal.
Female flowers dispersed along the branches, 7-9 mm long.
Inflorescences 1-3 per node, peduncle 10-15 cm long, rachis ca.

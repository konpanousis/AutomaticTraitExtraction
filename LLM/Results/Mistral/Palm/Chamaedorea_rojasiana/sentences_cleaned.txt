Rank: FLOWERING.
Some features of floral anatomy, including vascularisation of the ovule by a strand from each ventral bundle and abundant raphides in styles and stigmas, are characteristic of other genera in Chamaedoreeae and Ceroxyleae.
The bifid leaves are short and wide and look a bit like a butterfly or shortened fish-tail and have a few subtle ridges down them.
Germination adjacent-ligular, eophyll bifid or pinnate.
.Arial roots.
Generally rather small, often clustering, pinnate-leaved dioecious palms from the undergrowth of rain forest from Mexico southwards to South America, very diverse and with a wide range of habits including one climbing species, inflorescence and flower form equally varied.
Chamedorea oblongata.
Fruit small, globose or oblong, stigmatic remains basal, epicarp smooth, mesocarp fleshy, endocarp thin.
Staminate flowers symmetrical, sepals 3, entire, united basally or distinct, petals 3, distinct or variously connate, lobes valvate, stamens 6, filaments short, broad or awl-shaped, anthers dorsifixed, included, oblong or didymous, pistillode various, cylindric or expanded basally, sometimes trilobed.
Seed erect, globose, or ellipsoidal, hilum small, basal, branches of raphe obscure, endosperm cartilaginous, embryo basal to subapical.
The leaves are pinnate , with one to numerous leaflets.
Stem usually slender, covered wholly or partially in fibrous leaf bases or smooth, green, prominently ringed with leaf scars.
Leaves bifid or variously pinnate, very rarely entire, reduplicate, sheath closed or becoming split, short or elongate, sometimes with a marcescent lobe opposite the petiole, petiole short to elongate, flattened adaxially, rounded abaxially, sometimes with a prominent pale green or yellow, abaxial stripe, rachis rounded, angled, or flattened adaxially, rounded abaxially, blade entire, bifid and pinnately ribbed, or regularly or irregularly pinnately divided, leaflets few or many, of 1 or several folds, narrow or broad, often oblique or sigmoid, acuminate, surfaces glabrous.
In spite of their very slender stems, these palms tend to be strongly erect and are rarely found with the rooted, trailing stems that are characteristic of many older, small cloud forest Chamaedorea spp.
Fruits mature from green through brilliant orange thence black and add a colorful touch to females when halfway mature.
Inflorescences: interfoliar, peduncles 11-20 cm long, very slender, scarcely 2 mm thick near apex, erect or spreading, bracts 3-4, tubular, appressed, scarcely more than 3 mm broad, striatenerved.
Most adult plants in nature are between 80 cm and 1.20 m tall, although occasionally one encounters individuals with stems in excess of 1.80 m in height.
Flowers sessile or partly enclosed in a cavity in the fleshy rachilla, small or minute.
Small, sometimes moderate, erect or procumbent, rarely climbing, acaulescent or trunked, solitary or clustered, unarmed, pleonanthic, dioecious palms.
It grows to about 4.5' tall and has a very thin stem.
They are small palms, growing to 0.3-6 m tall with slender, cane-like stems, growing in the understory in rainforests , and often spreading by means of underground runners , forming clonal colonies.

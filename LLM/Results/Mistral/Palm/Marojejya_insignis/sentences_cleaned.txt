Inflorescence hidden amongst leaf bases, branched to 1 order.Biology
Rank: GERMINATING.
Staminate flowers rather small, somewhat asymmetrical due to close packing, sepals 3, free, unequal, narrow, ovate, keeled, chaffy, ciliate margined, tending to be widely separated, petals 3,
Pistillate rachillae shorter, thicker, and fewer than the staminate, densely brown tomentose, bearing crowded, spirally arranged, triangular bracts forming the lower lips of shallow pits, each pit bearing 3 membranous bracteoles, 2 very small abortive staminate flowers and a large solitary pistillate flower.
Stem erect, obscurely ringed with leaf scars, internodes short, sometimes with short root spines.
Germination adjacent-ligular, eophyll bifid, with or without a petiole.
In any case, like the others that have perished before it-- it is now turning an anemic yellow and the leaf edges are also turning brown.
M. insignis has different petioles and is distinctly pinnate.
Sometimes parts of the leaves do show some division - they are not always completely entire.
Rank: SEEDLING.
Spacing: 10-12 ft. 12-15 ft. 15-20 ft.
Leaves numerous, massive, pinnate or ± entire, the crown often filled with fibres, sheath with or without rounded auricles, petiole absent or thick and wide at the base, gradually tapering to the rachis, adaxially channelled, abaxially rounded, densely covered with caducous, dense brown scales, rachis adaxially deeply channelled, abaxially rounded basally, becoming laterally channelled distally, densely scaly at the base, blade undivided for ca.
Rank: FLOWERING.
A very attractive, medium to large solitary, pinnate,.litter trapping palm to 8m tall,.with up to 20 4-5m long leaves held in a "shuttlecock".type arrangement.
Root , ovule with distinct tannin and fibrous and vascular bundle layer around locule, ovule unusually large.
± pinnate leaves to 5 m long.
Pistillate flowers much larger than the staminate, obpyriform, somewhat asymmetrical, sepals 3, distinct, somewhat chaffy, ovate with triangular tips, ± striate, petals 3, distinct, similar to the sepals but larger and with short, triangular, valvate tips, staminodes 6, narrow, triangular, gynoecium gibbous, unilocular, uniovulate, gradually tapering to 3, large, triangular, recurved stigmas, ovule large, pendulous, campylotropous.
Fruit asymmetrically globular, perianth persistent, stigmatic remains forming a large lateral beak, epicarp smooth, mesocarp thin, granular, endocarp composed of several layers of broad, soft anastomosing fibres closely adhering to the seed.
Seed irregularly rounded, flattened, or ± kidney-shaped, smooth or grooved and ridged, subapically attached, endosperm homogeneous, embryo basal, opposite the fruit attachment.
Leaves pinnate, seed smooth.
Robust squat litter-trapping palms from rain forest in Madagascar, remarkable for their condensed unisexual inflorescences, found among the leaf sheaths, but with both sexes found on the same tree.
Individuals can grow to 8 m.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.
It still has enormous, wide, long leaves but these are irregularly split in a pinnate fashion, making the palm always look a bit on the wind-shredded side.
Leaves. pinnate with two or more leaflets.
Stout, solitary, unarmed, monoecious, pleonanthic palms.
± boat-shaped, valvate, coriaceous, connate basally for 1/3 their length and adnate to the receptacle, stamens 6, filaments basally connate, the distinct portions flattened, tapering, elongate, inflexed at the tip, anthers medifixed, ± versatile, latrorse, pistillode small, 3 lobed.

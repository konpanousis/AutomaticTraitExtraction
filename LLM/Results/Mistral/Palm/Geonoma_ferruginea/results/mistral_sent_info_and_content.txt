We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Geonoma ferruginea.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Stems clustering often caespitose forming lage clumps, 1-4 m tall and 2-2.5 cm in diameter, light brown.
Fruit ±globose, sometimes somewhat pointed, green, brown, or purple-black, 1-seeded, stigmatic remains basal, the rachillae often becoming brightly coloured, epicarp, thin smooth, mesocarp thin, with narrow longitudinal fibres, endocarp thin, crustaceous to membranous.
Pistillate flowers sunken in the pit with only the tips of the floral organs exserted, sepals 3, united basally and adnate to the receptacle, often keeled, free and imbricate distally, petals 3, connate in a soft tube, briefly adnate to receptacle basally, ending in 3, valvate, chaffy, spreading lobes, staminodes united in a tube, truncate, 6-toothed or 6-lobed, lobes, if present, spreading at anthesis, tubes basally adnate to the receptacle, and sometimes also the corolla tube, gynoecium tricarpellate but 2 carpels vestigial at anthesis, unilocular, uniovulate, ovule anatropous, style tubular, lateral to basal, elongate, ending in 3 linear stigmas, recurved at anthesis.
It is closely related to that species, differing in its shorter rachillae - 8.1 cm long versus 22.9 cm long - without short, transverse ridges.
Leaves 9 per stem, irregularly pinnate, not plicate, bases of the blades running diagonally into the rachis, sheaths 12.3 cm long, petioles 16.5 cm long, drying green or yellowish, rachis 30.7 cm long, 2.7 mm in diameter, veins raised and rectangular in cross-section adaxially, pinnae 4 per side of rachis, basal pinna 19.2 cm long, 2.6 cm wide, forming an angle of 65° with the rachis, apical pinna 14.8 cm long, 9.3 cm wide, forming an angle of 36° with the rachis.
Individuals can grow to 5 m.
Extremely variable genus of mostly rather small solitary or clustering palms from rain forest in Central and South America, with distinctive anthers with divergent thecae.
Several specimens have unusually high numbers of pinnae, 9-15 versus the more usual 3-5.
Palm Traits 1.0.0.536875
Small to moderate, solitary or clustered, unarmed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
Seed ± globose, hilum short, basal, raphe encircling the seed, endosperm homogeneous, embryo erect basal.

Blade 50 to 60 cm long, usually regularly divided into 3 sickle-shaped leaflets per side, occational 10-15 per side, narrow leaflets present, inflorescence borne between the leaves, branched to 1 to 2 orders, peduncle 5-9 cm long, flowering branches 4-13, short and thick, less than 10 cm long and 2-3.5 mm thick, becoming reddish in fruit, pits denesly and spirally arranged, fruits globose, slightly pointed at apex, 6-7 mm in diameter, mature fruit, black.
Geonoma is a genus of small to medium-sized palms native to the forest understorey of tropical Central and South America.
Leaves pinnate, regularly or irregularly divided, or entire and bifid, sheath short, splitting opposite the petiole, margins fibrous, glabrous or variously tomentose, petiole short to long, slightly grooved or flattened adaxially, rounded abaxially, glabrous or tomentose, blade bifid, or with 2 or 3 pairs of leaflets, or irregularly divided, or nearly evenly pinnate, thin and papery or somewhat leathery, usually glabrous adaxially, glabrous, tomentose or with scales abaxially, especially along the main ribs, uniseriate hairs present or absent, midribs of single folds conspicuous, transverse veinlets not evident.
Pollen ellipsoidal, usually with either slight or obvious asymmetry, aperture a distal sulcus, ectexine tectate, coarsely perforate or perforate and/or micro-channelled, and rugulate, aperture margin usually slightly finer, infratectum columellate, longest axis 22-48 µm.
Plants 2.4 m tall, stems 2.2 m tall, 1.0 cm in diameter, solitary or clustered, canelike, internodes 2.7 cm long, yellowish and smooth.
Stem very short, subterranean, erect, or creeping, slender, sometimes tall, enclosed by thin leaf sheaths, becoming bare, usually cane-like, ringed with close or distant, conspicuous or inconspicuous leaf scars.
Leaves 9 per stem, irregularly pinnate, not plicate, bases of the blades running diagonally into the rachis, sheaths 12.3 cm long, petioles 16.5 cm long, drying green or yellowish, rachis 30.7 cm long, 2.7 mm in diameter, veins raised and rectangular in cross-section adaxially, pinnae 4 per side of rachis, basal pinna 19.2 cm long, 2.6 cm wide, forming an angle of 65 ° with the rachis, apical pinna 14.8 cm long, 9.3 cm wide, forming an angle of 36 ° with the rachis.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

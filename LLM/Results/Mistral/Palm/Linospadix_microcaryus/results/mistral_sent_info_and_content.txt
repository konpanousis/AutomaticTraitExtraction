We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Linospadix microcaryus.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Inflorescence contains both male and female flowers, spikes about 30-80 cm long, peduncles about 40 cm long, male flowers opening and falling before the female flowers in the same cluster reach maturity.

Linospadix microcarya stands apart from the other.species due to some unique features: the leaf.lamina contains elongate clear 'cells' that.are visible under 10x magnification, fruit.is globose/turbinate, and staminate flowers.are globose and do not open widely at.anthesis.
Fruits globose to turbinate , about 4-8 mm diam., longitudinally ribbed with fibres.
Terminal leaflets or segments wider at the base than any of the lateral leaflets.
Leaves 28-70 cm long,.irregularly segmented with.united pinnae, segments broadly adnate to.the rachis, or regularly pinnate, petiole 1-23 cm long,.3-6 mm wide, pinnae 3-23 per.leaf, 11-36.5 cm long, by 0.9-7.4 cm wide,.
Leaves 28-70 cm long, irregularly segmented with united pinnae, segments with broad bases, or regularly pinnate, petiole 1-23 cm long, 3-6 mm wide, pinnae 3-23 per leaf, 11-36.5 cm long, by 0.9-7.4 cm wide, semiglossy, lettuce to mid-green above, sometimes dark green when in deep shade, lighter green below, midrib and secondary veins prominent on both surfaces, terminal pair broader than adjacent laterals and often basal pair broader than laterals, lamina, when backlit under 10X magnification, with numerous scattered clear elongate cells 0.5-1 mm long linearly parallel to midrib and veins.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

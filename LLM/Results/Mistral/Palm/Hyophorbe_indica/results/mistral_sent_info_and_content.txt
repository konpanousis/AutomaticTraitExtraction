We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Hyophorbe indica.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

I have set the binary evidence value to 1 for the following cases:

1. Fruit colour description: "chocolate", "orange", "orangish", "red", "reddish"
2. Fruit colour: "orange", "red"
3. Fruit shape: "ellipsoid", "globose", "ovoid"

All other binary evidence values remain 0, as there is no strong evidence for them in the input text.

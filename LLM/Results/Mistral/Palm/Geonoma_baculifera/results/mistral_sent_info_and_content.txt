We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Geonoma baculifera.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Geonoma is a genus of small to medium-sized palms native to the forest understorey of tropical Central and South America.
Leaves pinnate, regularly or irregularly divided, or entire and bifid, sheath short, splitting opposite the petiole, margins fibrous, glabrous or variously tomentose, petiole short to long, slightly grooved or flattened adaxially, rounded abaxially, glabrous or tomentose, blade bifid, or with 2 or 3 pairs of leaflets, or irregularly divided, or nearly evenly pinnate, thin and papery or somewhat leathery, usually glabrous adaxially, glabrous, tomentose or with scales abaxially, especially along the main ribs, uniseriate hairs present or absent, midribs of single folds conspicuous, transverse veinlets not evident.

Stem very short, subterranean, erect, or creeping, slender, sometimes tall, enclosed by thin leaf sheaths, becoming bare, usually cane-like, ringed with close or distant, conspicuous or inconspicuous leaf scars.
Palm 2.3 m tall, stems 1.6 m tall, 1.6 cm in diameter, solitary or clustered, canelike, internodes 4.1 cm long, yellowish and smooth.
Definitie: An autotroph which is capable of transforming light into chemical energy.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

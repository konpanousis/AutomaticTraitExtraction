Inflorescence: Sparsely branched with several long, thin rachillae, often covered with brown scaly hairs.
H.E.Moore : up to 5 m tall, variable in terms of leaf size, width and texture.
Leaves: Pinnate, varied from narrow to wide, glabrous to pubescent, small to large, and almost rubbery texture

Single stemmed , usually less than 3 m tall and 2-7 cm in diameter.
Fruit fusiform to ovoid, red at maturity, stigmatic remains apical, epicarp thin, smooth, becoming pebbled when dry, mesocarp fleshy, fibrous, with stinging crystals, fibres adherent to the thin, rather smooth endocarp, endocarp usually circular in cross-section, 5-lobed in D. hentyi and D. subdistichus).

Leaflets broad, dark green, with premorse leaf tips.
Small to moderate, solitary pinnate-leaved palms, native to Moluccas, New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, Solomon Islands and Samoa, with crownshaft and praemorse leaflets, elongate peduncles and seed rounded in cross section, the endosperm can be ruminate or homogeneous.

It is indeed quite variable and like most understory palms, individuals of these species vary in terms of leaf size, width and texture, even when the floral and fruit characters are uniform.

Moderate solitary pinnate-leaved tree palms ofhumid rain forest in Central and South America, the stems with an opencone of stilt roots, leaflets are rhomboid praemorse, sometimeslongitudinally divided to give the whole leaf an ostrich-featherappearance, fruit has apical stigmatic remains and embryo.
Paphiopedilum insigne Pfitzer.
Inflorescences solitary, infrafoliar, somewhat dorsiventrally compressed and erect inbud, branching to 1 order, branches pendulous when exposed,protogynous, peduncle well developed, elliptic in cross-section,winged at base, prophyll inserted near the base, short, tubular, 2-keeled, apically open, thinly coriaceous, peduncular bracts ca.
Solitary or very rarely clustered, moderate, pleonanthic, monoecioustree palms.
Seed ± ovoid, basally attached, hilum circular, raphe branches conspicuous, numerous, sparsely anastomosing, endosperm homogeneous, embryo eccentrically apical.
Rank: SEEDLING.
Staminate flowers open in bud, sepals 3, triangular, united basally in alow, complete or partially interrupted ring, petals 3, distinct, fleshy, markedly asymmetrical, lightly imbricate basally, much longer than the sepals, stamens 17-145, filaments very short, awl-shaped above expanded bases, anthers erect, basifixed, linear, acute or apiculate, latrorse, pistillode much shorter than the stamens, conical, briefly trifid.
Pistillate flowers symmetrical, much smaller than the staminate, ± 3-angled, sepals 3, rounded, strongly imbricate, dorsally thickened, petals 3, distinct, strongly imbricate, ± rounded with a minute, triangular valvate apex, staminodes 6, minute, tooth-like, gynoecium obovoid, tricarpellate, triovulate, stigmas 3, apical, fleshy, reflexed, ovules basally attached, orthotropous, one usually larger than the others.
Fruit separated at maturity, ellipsoidal to subglobose with eccentrically apical stigmatic remains, epicarp minutely roughened when dry, at maturity splitting into ± distinct valves at apex, exposing the rather dry white mesocarp with included reddish sclerosomes and slender fibres, endocarp thin.
Pinnae simple.
Stems solitary or occasionally clustered.
Pollen ellipsoidal, ± bi-symmetric, aperture a distal sulcus, ectexine intectate, upper surface of foot layer covered by fine, dense gemmae or clavae, loosely supporting short, wide-spaced, broad-based spines, longest axis 43-50 µm.
Stems erect, conspicuously ringed with leaf scars, bearingan open cone of stout, usually densely prickly, stilt roots.
Rank: FLOWERING.

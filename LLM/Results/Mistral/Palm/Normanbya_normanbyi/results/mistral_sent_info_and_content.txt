We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Normanbya normanbyi.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The leaves, on short petiole covered by a thick whitish tomentum and brown scales, are pinnate, curved, 2-3 m long, with rachis covered by thick brown scales and pinnules that in the adult plants are arranged irragularly and at different angles around it, subdivided up to almost the base in 7-9 parallel segments, 30-50 cm long and 1-3 cm broad, with truncated and toothed apex, of dark green colour above, covered by thick and tiny bluish white scales below.
Growing in an area where cyclones are relatively common, a slender stem supports a rich feathery crown, often up to 30 meters in the canopy.
The fruits.
They are around 90 cm long and the sessile green flowers are grouped in threes, each with one pistillate and two staminate flowers.
Pistillate flowers ovoid, sepals 3, distinct, broadly imbricate, rounded pink to purplish-brown at maturity, stigmatic remains apical forming a with short pointed tips, margins slightly fringed, petals 3, like the sepals short beak, epicarp somewhat fleshy, drying wrinkled, mesocarp rather but longer and with short valvate tips, staminodes 3, broadly tooth-like, thin, with longitudinal, branched, straw-coloured fibres adherent to the gynoecium narrowly ovoid, unilocular, uniovulate, narrowing shortly smooth endocarp.

Germination adjacent-form unknown.
Each palm can bear up to three inflorescences/infructescences at the same time.
Ripe fruits measure between 35 to 50 mm long and 25 to 40 mm in width, and are pink to reddish-brown in colour.
The trunk is smooth, slender,.and closely ringed, and becomes almost black as the palm gets older.
The leaves on seedlings are rather scrawny and unattractive, and it isn't.until the palm gets to several metres high that the thick plumed leaves appear.
Single trunk, faint rings, thin. trunk.
It is a single-stemmed palm with attractive "bushy" fronds , similar to a bottlebrush.
It grows to a height of 30 m with a small crown of fronds each measuring around 2.5 m long with a petiole about 30 cm long.
A single inflorescence consists of about 1900 staminate and 800 pistillate flowers.
Fruit and abaxial leaf surface.
These consist of many narrow leaflets, arranged circularly around the leaf stalk, which gives it a very bushy appearance, very similar to the Foxtail palm, Wodyetia bifurcata.

The fruits are ovoid with pointed apex, pink to reddish brown when ripe, 4,5 cm long and of 3 cm of diameter, with 0,5-1 mm broad fibres present in the mesocarp, containing one seed only.
The fronds have 75-95 whorled pinnae up to 45 cm in length, each of which are divided longitudinally into 7-11 radiating segments, giving the fronds the bushy appearance.
This is a tall, handsome palm, growing about 20 metres tall, with a 4 metre leaf spread.
The pinnae are dark green on the upper surface and silvery underneath and the tips are abruptly truncated.
The trunk is smooth, slender, and closely ringed, and becomes almost black with age.
The fronds have 75-95 whorled pinnae up to 45 cm in length, each of which are divided longitudinally into 7-11 radiating segments, giving the fronds the bushy appearance.
Pink to red-brown at maturity.
The trunk is smooth, slender, and closely ringed, and becomes almost black as the palm gets older.
Rank: GERMINATING.
Spacing: 36-48 in.
Occasionally you see individuals like this with not-very-plumose fronds with comparatively broad pinnae.
Moderate to tall, solitary, unarmed, pleonanthic, monoecious palm.
The leaves on seedlings are rather scrawny and unattractive, and it isn't until the palm gets to several metres high that the thick plumed leaves appear.
A nice exotic appearing palm that resembles the Foxtail Palm but is a bit more tropical appearing and has silver on the underside of the leaflets.
Normanbya normanbyi is visually very similar to the more well-known Foxtail palm but is slightly smaller in all respects.
Ripe fruits measure between 35 to 50 mm long and 25 to 40 mm in width, and are pink to reddish-brown in colour.
There is a pale green crownshaft, topped with a small head of leaves.
There is a pale green crown-shaft, topped with a small head of leaves.
These consist of many narrow leaflets, arranged circularly around the.leaf stalk, which gives it a very bushy appearance, very similar to the.
Inflorescence within the leaves, to 90 cm long.
The green inflorescence comes from below the crown-shaft,.and gives rise to 5cm long pear-shaped, light-brown coloured fruit.
Leaves 2.5 m long, arching, 75-95 pinnae each side of rachis, leafsheath to 120 cm long, light green with white to green tomentum, petiole to 30 cm, densely scaly.
Single stemmed palm up to 30 m tall.
In fact, the two palms are very difficult to tell apart, the main difference being that N. normanbyi has a silverish tinge to the underside of the leaves.
They look very similar initially to Foxtail palms but have slightly wider leaflets and have less stout trunks.
Male flowers with dark green sepals , yellowish-green to cream petals, 24-40 stamens.
Seed 35 mm long x 25 mm wide, endosperm deeply ruminate , seed coat orange-red.
The staminate flowers have 24 to 40 stamens, the pistillate flowers have three strongly recurved stigmas.
And the tip of the leaflet looks brown.
Leaf Detail.
Stem erect, moderate, ringed with distinct leaf scars, vertically striate, grey, bulbous basally.
Open / Close.
Pinnae to 45 cm long, divided longitudinally to the base into 7-11 segments.
Female flowers with mid-green sepals, light green petals, 3 stigmas are strongly recurved.
The inflorescence is a panicle and is borne on the trunk just below the crownshaft.
The flowers are around 1cm and superficially resemble a pea flower.
The inflorescences, initially enclosed in two about 30 cm long bracts, generate under the leaves on short peduncle, are drooping, ramified, 60-90 cm long, with whitish unisexual flowers arranged in triad in the lower part, whilst in the terminal part are present only male flowers solitary or in couple.
Seeds, about an inch across.
They are around 90 cm long and the sessile green flowers are grouped in threes, each with one pistillate and two staminate flowers.
Plumose. , pinnate.
The foliar base wraps completely the stem per a length of 0,6-1 m forming a sort of a tubular capital, just enlarged at the base, of ash grey colour with brownish apex.
Flowers sessile , in groups of three consisting of one male and two female.
The Normanbya normanbyi L.H.Bailey is an unarmed monoecious species with solitary erect stem, smooth, with bulbous base crossed by vertical fissures, up to about 20 m tall with a diameter of 15-20 cm, of greyish colour tending to turn always darker with age, and on which are visible the rings trace of the junction of tha fallen leaves.
Single trunk, faint rings, thin trunk.
They contain a single seed about 35 by 25 mm.
As palms go, this palm has a very unique frond type found in very few palms – the leaflets are arranged spirally around the leaf rachis, giving each frond a very bushy appearance.
It grows to a height of 30 m with a small crown of fronds each measuring around 2.5 m long with a petiole about 30 cm long.
Fruit are 35-50 mm long x 25-39 mm wide, ovoid , with a c. 5 mm beak at the apex.
Seed laterally attached with a long unbranched raphe, above the ovarian region to 3, large reflexed stigmas, ovule pendulous, hilum lateral, endosperm ruminate, embryo basal.
This is a tall, handsome palm, growing about 20 metres tall,.with a 4 metre leaf spread.
They contain a single seed about 35 by 25 mm.
Spectacular, moderate solitary pinnate-leaved palm, native to northeastern Queensland, Australia, with crownshaft and praemorse leaflets, the leaflets longitudinally divided into many segments that are splayed out, giving the whole leaf a foxtail appearance, the fruit is relatively large and has thin pale fibres next to the endocarp, the seed has ruminate endosperm.
The green inflorescence comes from below the crownshaft, and gives rise to 5 cm long pear-shaped, light-brown coloured fruit.

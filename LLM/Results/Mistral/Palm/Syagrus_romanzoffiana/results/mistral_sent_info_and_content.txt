We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Syagrus romanzoffiana.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

This means with each leaf nearly a foot of trunk height resulted.
Leaflets spead in several planes, irregularly spaced along the rachis in groups of two to seven, with drooping leaftips.
Palm with a columnar, single, trunk, 30-50 cm of diameter, tall up to about 16-18 metres, smooth, of greyish colour and with the rings of the scars of the foliar petioles well spaced and not much evident, particularly in the oldest part of the trunk.

The bright orange fruits are up to 11 centimetres long.
Species range from large trees with stout stems up to 30 metres tall to acaulescent palms.
The peduncle is the main stalk, connecting the rachis with the stem.
The inflorescence consists of a main axis-the peduncle and the rachis -and a series of smaller branches, the rachillae.
Attalea is a genus of non-spiny palms with pinnately compound leaves-rows of leaflets emerge on either side of the axis of the leaf in a feather-like or fern-like pattern.
This produces a "saxophone shaped" belowground portion of the stem.
A. phalerata is monoecious, but the staminate and pistillate inflorescence on individual palms flower asynchronously so the species is considered functionally dioecious.
Male inflorescence of Attalea sp. swarming with insects.
A stout, solitary palm whose trunk rarely gets taller than 4m.and which is often covered with old leaf bases.
Life forms of Attalea species vary from small acaulescent palms to tall and massive palms, always solitary.
Inflorescences are large, branched and borne among the leaves.
The comet findings were classified as follows: class 0-no damage, class 1-comet tail shorter than the diameter of the nucleoid, class 2-comet tail once or twice the diameter of the nucleoid and class 3-comet tail greater than twice the size of the nucleoid.
It has up to 30 feather-like leaves.
A stout, solitary palm whose trunk rarely gets taller than 4m and which is often covered with old leaf bases.
The fruit are animal-dispersed.
Rank: FLOWERING.
This palm grows up to 18 metres tall, the trunk rarely reaching more than 4 metres.
The stem is often covered with old leaf bases.
A "stout, single-stemmed, evergreen palm whose unbranched stem rarely gets taller than 4 metres, though occasional specimens up to 7 metres are found.
The tree can reach 20 meters high, with a 20-35 cm diameter.
It has large bunches of bright yellow, oily fruits that are up to 11cm long.
Large palms with complex crowns and some medium-crowned palms are often infested, in slender, small-crowned palms triatomines associate with vertebrate nests.
This pinnately leaved, non-spiny genus includes both small palms lacking an aboveground stem and large trees.
It has a plumose head of up to 30 large leaves that are held erect in a shuttlecock-like crown.
The stem can be 30 - 40 cm.
It has a plumose head.of up to 30 large leaves that are held erect in a shuttlecock-like crown.
Inflorescences either consist entirely of male flowers, or are predominantly female with a few male flowers.
Fruit usually have two or three seeds, although fewer or more are present in some species, and are usually brown, yellow, orange-brown or purple when mature.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Geonoma cuneata.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Definitie: A leaf having two or more distinct leaflets that are evident as such from early in development.
They differ in their shorter plant height, shorter leaf sheaths, shorter and thinner rachis, more pinnae, wider basal pinna angles, shorter and thinner apical pinnae, thinner peduncles, and shorter rachillae.
Leaves pinnate, petioles drying green or yellowish, veins not raised or slightly raised and triangular in crosssection adaxially, rachis 71.3 cm long, pinnae 12 per side of rachis.
Leaves undivided or pinnate, petioles drying green or yellowish, veins raised and rectangular in cross-section adaxially, rachis 45.1 cm long, pinnae 3 per side of rachis.
In western Ecuador and extreme southwestern Colombia at low elevations , a few specimens, have small, undivided leaves with raised adaxial veins.
Definitie: whole plant growth form.
Leaves 10 per stem, undivided or irregularly pinnate, not plicate, bases of blades running diagonally into the rachis, sheaths 20.0 cm long, petioles 30.7 cm long, drying orangebrown, reddish-brown, or green or yellowish, rachis 46.4 cm long, 4.1 mm in diameter, veins raised and rectangular in cross-section adaxially or not raised or slightly raised and triangular in crosssection adaxially, pinnae 3 per side of rachis, basal pinna 32.7 cm long, 5.8 cm wide, forming an angle of 31째 with the rachis, apical pinna 22.9 cm long, 10.7 cm wide, forming an angle of 31째 with the rachis.
Specimens have undivided or pinnate leaves with raised adaxial veins.

Geonoma is a genus of small to medium-sized palms native to the forest understorey of tropical Central and South America.
They are similar to Atlantic slope specimens in their undivided or pinnate leaves with raised adaxial veins.
Botany: small to medium-sized palms, understory, sub-canopy, habitat tropical lowland and montane forests, Geonomeae are characterized by three morphological synapomorphies: the petals of pistillate flowers are basally connate, the presence of slender and elongate styles, and the flowers are borne in pits in the rachillae.
Herb, Shrub, Acaulescent palm, Solitary palm.
Plants 1.4 m tall, stems 0.7 m tall, 1.5 cm in diameter, solitary or clustered, not cane-like or cane-like, internodes 0.9 cm long, yellowish and smooth, or, if short and congested, not scaly.
They have undivided or pinnate leaves with pronounced adaxial veins.
Palm 1.4 m tall, stems 0.7 m tall, 1.5 cm in diameter, solitary or clustered, not cane-like or cane-like, internodes 0.9 cm long, yellowish and smooth, or, if short and congested, not scaly.
Definitie: An autotroph which is capable of transforming light into chemical energy.
Leaves 10 per stem, undivided or irregularly pinnate, not plicate, bases of blades running diagonally into the rachis, sheaths 20.0 cm long, petioles 30.7 cm long, drying orangebrown, reddish-brown, or green or yellowish, rachis 46.4 cm long, 4.1 mm in diameter, veins raised and rectangular in cross-section adaxially or not raised or slightly raised and triangular in crosssection adaxially, pinnae 3 per side of rachis, basal pinna 32.7 cm long, 5.8 cm wide, forming an angle of 31째 with the rachis, apical pinna 22.9 cm long, 10.7 cm wide, forming an angle of 31 째 with the rachis.
They are similar to subspecies indivisa except they have orange-brown petioles and rachis.
Inflorescences staminate flowers deciduous after anthesis, non-fertilized pistillate flowers deciduous after anthesis.
Some specimens have leaves which dry a gray-green color.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

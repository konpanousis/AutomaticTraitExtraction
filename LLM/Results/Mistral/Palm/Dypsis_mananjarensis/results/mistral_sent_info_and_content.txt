We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Dypsis mananjarensis.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Pinnate, plumose, "mealy bug petiole" giving.
Today the tips of the leaves reach about 6ft.
Definitie: whole plant growth form.
A slow growing solitary trunked palm from Madagascar who in habitat gets quite large.
This 'species' has long, very neatly organized, wide lancelot leaflets with almost a rounded end, and deep pink-brown, almost fuzzy-looking petioles, with only a hint of dark speckling , that sadly disappears as palms age.
Rank: SEEDLING.
Itâ€™s ringed with white leaf base scars.
.Each spear longer and thicker.
Rank: FLOWERING.
As youngsters these palms apparantly have extremely vivdly coloured.leaf petioles and rhachis, streaked with red, white and black.
Tall, to 25m, solitary, tristichous palm, with slightly plumose leaves.
The leaves seem much bigger and the trunk a lot thicker.
Spacing: 12-15 ft. 15-20 ft.
Individuals can grow to 25 m.
.Maroantsetra - clearly an understory Dypsis based on seed size/shape.
The markings on the petioles are striking.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.
No trunk yet but 6-8ft leaves and great coloring.
Definitie: An autotroph which is capable of transforming light into chemical energy.
Large, single trunk, speckled crownshaft.
Plants are mostly upright in appearance.
Large, single trunk,.
Full. sun.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

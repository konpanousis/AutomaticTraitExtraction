We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Cocos nucifera.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Female flowers 1 or fewer than male flowers, larger, spherical structures, about 25 mm in diameter.
Fruit a drupe, roughly ovoid, up to 30 cm long and 20 cm wide, composed of a thick, fibrous husk surrounding a somewhat spherical nut with a hard, brittle, hairy shell.
The axillary inflorescence has globular.clusters of female flowers.
The roots are woody but elastic, rigid and strong.

Three color forms - MGD, MRD and MYD - set first fruit at about waist-heig.
Seed - Fresh seed germinates readily at 27 - 30Â°c.
Type: Broadleaf evergreen.
The. leaflets near the base of the leaf are about 30 inches long and half an inch wide, those.
Size.33oz 2oz.
Tepals 6 arranged in two whorls of three each, persistent and polyphyllous showing valvate aestivation in both the whorls.
Flowers are protandrous, the female flowers open, after the male flowers have withered.
Flowers are small and light yellow, in clusters that emerge from canoe-shaped sheaths among the leaves.
The stem is an unbranched type, and at its apex,.a tuft of leaves protects a single apical bud.
The fruit is a drupe comprised of three layers: the exocarp, mesocarp , and the endocarp.
C. nucifera palms are unbranched, monoecious trees with smooth, columnar, light grey-brown trunk, usually 9-18 m height and sometimes taller , dwarf selections also exist.
At the rosette stage the growing point continues to enlarge until the size of the leaf initials reflects the prevailing growing conditions, then trunk formation starts.
Inflorescence consists of female and male axillary flowers.
Male flowers are small and more numerous.
Female flowers are followed by single-seeded coconuts.
Creamy white to yellow.
Tepals 6 arranged in two whorls of three each, persistent, and polyphyllous showing imbricate aestivation in both the whorls.
Inflorescence :.Large, lateral arising from the axils of leaves, compound spadix, enclosed by large woody bract called spathe.
Two of these eyes are hard and smaller than the third.
This is a single-trunked palm with a branchless, often-curved, light gray trunk which is swollen at the base and topped by a crown of pinnate, downward-arching, green fronds.
Each new leaf is at an angle of about 144 degrees around the stem from the last one.
When an inflorescence bursts from the spathe, flowering begins with male flowers.
Trees will typically mature to 50-100' tall over time.
The seed has no dormancy, and growth of the embryo and seedling is continuous.
Style is absent and stigmas three.
Latin Name Common Name Habit Height Hardiness Growth Soil Shade Moisture Edible Medicinal Other.
C. nucifera is tall slender and graceful palm.
C. nucifera  is a palm tree with a great capacity for natural dispersal.
On some palms the leaves spiral about the stem to the left and on others to the right.
Tall palms tend to be slow maturing, flowering 6 - 10 years after planting and with a life-span of 80 - 100 years.
The endosperm is soft and jellylike when immature but becomes firm with maturity.
Generally one female flower is located near the base of each spikelet,.
The stem bears some 40 secondary branches, or spikelets, which bear flowers.
The fruits are green at first, turning brownish as they mature, yellow varieties go from yellow to brown.

The plant is an arborescent monocotyledonous tree of around 25 m in height with a dense canopy.
Exocarp in immature fruit is green.
Large, Medium, Small.
Coconut, cocus nucifera, is a monoecious large palm of about 30 m tall with long pinnate leaves that break away cleanly leaving the unbranched trunk smooth.
Roots grow from the base of the germinating plant downward around.
Young plant up to 5 year old.
The stem is red-brown with a coarse texture and straight to entangled grain.
Young leaves are bright green.
Main stem of the inflorescence grows up to five to six feet.
A new inflorescence is produced every month, whilst the fruit takes a year to mature.
Male flowers open first, producing pollen for about 2 weeks.
Unbranched tree with arborescent stem and a crown of large leaves.
De Veiling.
Each spike in the spadix bears 2 to 3 female flowers at the base and 200 to 300 male flowers at the top.
The fruit consists of a thin hard skin , a thicker layer of fibrous mesocarp , the hard endocarp , the white endosperm , and a large cavity filled with watery liquid.
Cocos nucifera is an evergreen Tree growing to 25 m by 7 m at a medium rate.
It grows to a height of 60 to 100 feet.
The palm terminates in a crown of long pinnate leaves.
Leaf stalks 1-2 cm in length and thorn-less.
Fragrant yellow flowers in elongated clusters to 4' long only appear in tropical climates where they bloom on and off throughout the year.
The pinnate leaves are feather-shaped,.having a petiole, rachis and leaflets.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

The inflorescences are unbranched or branch once, a single hybrid, S.
Palms in this genus usually have solitary stems, clustered stems are less common, and a few are stolon -like subterranean.
The leaves of all but one species, S. smithii , are pinnately compound.
Leaf , root , fruit.
Seed conforming to the shape of the endocarp cavity, subbasally attached, endosperm homogeneous or ruminate, sometimes with a central cavity, embryo basal or subbasal opposite one of the endocarp pores.
The stems are topped by crowns of 10 - 30 stiffly erect leaves, which can each be up to 3 metres long.
.Detail leaf.
Graceful undergrowth palms from eastern Brazil with distinctive slender discolorous leaflets and fruit in which the pericarp splits longitudinally when ripe, exposing the endocarp.
Extremely variable genus native to the Caribbean and South America, where it is particularly abundant in drier areas, leaflets are concolourous and the mesocarp does not split.
Syagrus coronata with spineless cactus.
An acaulescent palm with very tough, leathery,.upright, dark green, glaucous leaves that get to about 2m tall.
A short, edible palm with 1-1 1/2" fruits.
They are monoecious , with both male and female flowers borne in the same inflorescence.
On the right is a picture of green fruit on the right and near.mature fruit on the left,.ripening to the.yellow color.
Rank: SEEDLING.
The stems are normally spineless, but some species have spiny leaf sheaths or spines.
An average tree can carry as many as 15 leaves or more.
The leaves get a length of up to 12 feet and are plumose, or.multi-ranked.
The transition from the leaf sheath to the petiole can be gradual and difficult to identify, but in species where they can be distinguished, leaf sheaths are 2.5-180 cm long and the petioles are 0-30 cm.
Seed laterally attached with broad lateral hilum, endosperm homogeneous or deeply ruminate , with or without a central hollow, embryo basal opposite an endocarp pore.
Description A short palm tree growing to 3-6 feet tall.
The fruit are drupes, which vary in colour from green to orange to brown.
Each leaf can be quite heavy and the petiole bases are fibrous and thick.
Rank: FLOWERING.
Pistillate flowers slightly smaller to very much larger than the staminate flowers, sepals 3, distinct, broadly imbricate, triangular to ovate, acute or obtuse, fleshy to coriaceous, sometimes tomentose or scaly, petals 3, distinct, slightly shorter to slightly longer the than the sepals, triangular or ovate, broadly imbricate at the base, with minute to moderately large and conspicuous valvate tips, staminodal ring membranous, low, ± 6-toothed, occasionally apparently absent, gynoecium columnar to conical or ovoid, trilocular, triovulate, glabrous or tomentose to scaly, the stigmas 3, reflexed, fleshy, ovules laterally attached to the central wall of the locules, ?
Fruit small to relatively large, 1-seeded, spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal, variously green, brown, yellow, or reddish, sometimes beaked, the perianth segments and staminodal ring persistent and sometimes enlarging as a cupule at the fruit base, epicarp smooth or longitudinally striate, glabrous or hairy, mesocarp fleshy or dry, with abundant longitudinal fibres, endocarp thick, woody, with 3 basal or subbasal pores, sometimes beaked, sometimes with 3 longitudinal ridges, rarely with 3 irregular vertical bands of minute pores, endocarp cavity irregular or more usually circular, rarely triangular in cross-section, with 3, conspicuous, vertical lines, very rarely with a curved lateral protrusion into the seed.
x lacerdamourae , occasionally shows second-order branching, and emerge from between the leaves.
Stem very short, subterranean to erect and tall, rarely stolon-like, sometimes swollen basally, distally obscured by leaf-base remains, becoming bare, sometimes striate, and marked with inconspicuous or raised or impressed, oblique or circular conspicuous leaf scars.
The.outer bract of the flower is quite woody when mature and has a very sharp point.on
The fruit is up to 35mm long by 25mm wide.
Slender, solitary, unarmed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
Those species that have upright trunks grow 2-36 metres tall with stems that are 6-35 centimetres in diameter.
A fibrous, succulent flesh with a sweet, pleasant flavour.
This means with each leaf nearly a foot of trunk height resulted.
Pollen ellipsoidal, frequently elongate, usually with either slight or obvious asymmetry, aperture a distal sulcus, ectexine tectate, finely or coarsely perforate, perforate and micro-channelled, or perforate-rugulate, aperture margin may be slightly finer, infratectum columellate, longest axis 34-54 µm.
Small to tall, solitary or clustered, rarely forking below ground , unarmed or armed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
Inflorescences solitary, interfoliar, rarely spicate, usually branching to 1 order, ?
Stem erect, short, rarely exceeding 3 m, at first obscured by leaf sheath remains, later bare, closely ringed with leaf scars.
They range in size from 1.2 to 1.9 cm in length, and 0.7 to 4.5 cm in diameter.
Ariri is an, stemless palm producing a cluster of subterranean stems and growing up to 3 metres tall.
Spacing: 4-6 ft. 6-8 ft.
The fruits are an intense yellow when mature and fall to the.ground when ready for germination.
The crown is full and rounded.
Examples of very tall Queen.Palms.
An acaulescent palm with very tough, leathery, upright, dark green, glaucous leaves that get to about 2 m tall.
Germination adjacent-ligular or remote tubular, eophyll entire.

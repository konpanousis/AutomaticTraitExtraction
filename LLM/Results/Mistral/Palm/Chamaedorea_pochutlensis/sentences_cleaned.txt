Rank: FLOWERING.
The Chamaedorea pochutlensis Liebm. is a dioecious species forming quickly dense tufts with erect or slightly inclined stems, of 2-5 m of length and of 2-2,5 cm of diameter, of intense green colour and on which are visible the whitish rings of the foliar scars spaced of 6-25 cm.
Mexican clumping palm often confused with the very similar Chamaedorea costaricana which, however, is easily distinguished by the absence of the ligule.
The two are similar in their long-pinnate leaves and clustering habit but the presence on the ligules at the apex of the leaf sheath easily distinguishes C. costaricana, a feature lacking in C. pochutlensis.
Leaves: 3-5, erect-spreading, pinnate, to 2 m long, sheath to 30 cm long, tubular, obliquely open apically, longitudinally striate- nerved, green but drying pale or whitish, persistent, petiole to 30 cm long, ± flat and green above but toward base grooved and smooth, green and rounded below, rachis to I m long or more, angled and green above, rounded below with a pale or light green band extending onto sheath, petiole and sheath ± slightly glaucous, pinnae 20-33 on each side of rachis, to 40 x 2-3 cm, long-lanceolate, slightly curved or falcate or ± straight, regularly arranged, alternate or subopposite, plicate and contracted basally and there with a hard whitish swollen gland at point ofattachment with rachis, acute apically, a prominent pale midrib and 2 submarginal primary nerves, secondaries and tertiaries inconspicuous.
The big, round fruit had a. deflated or smashed seed.
Staminate with 12-25 rachillae, these 15-20 cm long, 2-2.5 mm diam., ± drooping, green.
The leaves are pinnate , with one to numerous leaflets.
A beautiful palm with clustering, slender, green, cane-like stems and elegantly arching, glossy green, pinnate leaves with numerous wide segments, generally similar to and frequently confused with C. costaricana.
Receptive females will have the tips of the flower "valves' open and the stigma visible, sometimes with glistening stigmatic fluid evident.
The tubular foliar base, open obliquely at the apex, of pale green colour and initially covered, like the petiole, by a thin pale blue waxy patina, wraps entirely the stem for a length of 20-30 cm.
Stems: 2-3 cm diam., green, ringed, internodes 10-25 cm long, often covered with persistent sheaths.
Flowers: Staminate in ± dense spirals, 4-4.5 x 3-3.5 mm, ovoid-globose, bright yellow, strongly aromatic, slightly sunken, calyx 1 x 2.5-3 mm, lobed, green, sepals connate in basal 2/3, rounded to acute apically, petals 3.5-4 x 3 mm, ovate, free nearly to base, spreading, acute and slightly recurved apically, ± thick, fleshy, stamens 2.5 mm high, filaments 1-1.5 mm long, pale, anthers 1.5-2 mm long, not deeply 2-cleft, pistillode 4 mm high, columnar, equalling petals, 3-lobed apically, yellowish.
Inflorescences, on a 25-35 cm long peduncle, under the leaves , erect, ramified, the male ones with green flowers, of about 4 mm of diameter, drawn near and arranged spirally, the female ones with yellow flowers, of about 4 mm of diameter, spaced and arranged spirally on the rachils initially of green colour, then reddish orange when in fruit.
Spacing: 4-6 ft. 6-8 ft.
The leaves, on a 15-30 cm long petiole, are pinnate, 1-1,6 m long, with 15-30 alternate or sub-opposite leaflets regularly arranged on both sides of the rachis, lanceolate with pointed apex, 15-35 cm long and 1,5-3 cm broad, of intense green colour.

Inflorescences: infrafoliar, erect-spreading, peduncles 30-40 cm long, 7-10 mm wide at base, 5 mm wide at apex, green in flower, reddish orange in fruit, bracts 5-7, prophyll 3 cm long, 2nd bract 6 cm, 3rd 10 cm, 4th 12 cm, 5th 15 cm, 6th 15-20 cm, 7th 810 cm, fibrous, dry and brownish in flower, obliquely open and bifid apically, acute-acuminate, longitudinally striate-nerved, uppermost exceeding peduncle and extending onto rachis, rachises 10 cm long, green in flower, reddish orange in fruit.
Pistillate in remote spirals, 4-5 x 3 mm, ovoid, yellow, calyx 1-1.5 x 3 mm, deeply lobed, green, sepals briefly connate and/ or imbricate basally, broadly rounded apically, petals 3 x 3 mm, deltoid, imbricate nearly to apex, spreading, free and erect apically, acute, pistil 3.5 x 2.5-3 mm, ovoid-globose, green, styles very short or lacking, stigma lobes short, recurved to erect, dark, equalling petals.
They are small palms, growing to 0.3-6 m tall with slender, cane-like stems, growing in the understory in rainforests , and often spreading by means of underground runners , forming clonal colonies.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Licuala paludosa.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Red seed of Fan palm.
Palm J. 136: 7 - 20.
The plants have thin stems, with a diameter of 5 cm, covered by brown fibres.
Rank: GERMINATING.
In the plants exposed to the direct sun, the petioles may get a vivid orange colour, turning yellow or yellow/green in the specimens in the shade.
The interfoliar inflorescences, erect and projected beyond the leaves, are ramified in 5-8 straight filiform rachillae, covered by down, 12-20 cm long.
Licuala paludosa is a monoecious, multi-stemmed species, forming dense shrubs up to 6 m tall and up to 9 m broad.
The fruits are globose or ovoid, with an up to 1 cm diametre, of red-orange colour or completely red when ripe, and contain only one seed.
Licuala paludosa seeds.
Definitie: whole plant growth form.
Si riproduce per divisione dei cespi o per seme, che germina in circa 2 mesi, su letto caldo.
Spacing: 15-20 ft. 20-30 ft.
Licuala paludosa - PALMS IN POTS - PalmTalk.
Rank: SEEDLING.
It produces long hanging inflorescences and orange-red fruit.
Beautiful, tall, open clumping split-leaf fan palm from Asia- similar to Licuala spinosa, but more elegant and spread out, with longer, more delicate leaves.
Rank: FLOWERING.
The small hermaphrodite flowers are glabrous and sessile and present  short oval petals of cream colour.
The petioles are very long, up to 2,5 m, and present on the margins small black thorns, 0,5 cm long, distributed from the base of the petioles to half of its length.
Licuala paludosa is quite similar to the congener Licuala spinosa , but looks more elegant, with bigger and thinner leaves and coloured petioles.
Not a brown tip on her.
Licuala spp. are fan palms, with the leaves mostly circular in outline, sometimes undivided but more usually divided into wedge-shaped segments.
Definitie: An autotroph which is capable of transforming light into chemical energy.
Every stem is surmounted by a crown of 9-10 palmate leaves, circular and flat, up to 1,5 m broad, with the lamina completely divided up to the base in 7-20 bright green segments, all of the same size, run by evident veins, with truncated and toothed apex.
Usually single trunked, but occasionally clumping fan palm to about 4m high.
Palm J. 134: 28 - 37.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

Large attractive palm to about 20m, with a very solid trunk.
Description Roystonea lenis is a large palm which reaches heights of 20 metres.
Inflorescences occur beneath the crownshaft, emerging from a narrow, horn-shaped bract.
Inflorescence about 1 m. long and 1 m. wide, prophyll not seen, peduncular bract about 1.8 m. long, widest at the middle, apex acuminate, rachillae puberulent, 14-31 cm.
Roystonea lenis, is a palm tree which could grow upto the height of 18- 25 mtrs of height.
The Royal Palms - spectacular majestic solitary pinnate-leaved palms from the Craibbean islands and neighbouring parts of North, Central and South America, crownshaft is very conspicuous and the inflorescence branched to at least 4 orders with rather stiff spreading rachillae.
Individuals have about 15 leaves with 0.2-0.7 cm petioles and 4-5.8-metre rachises , the leaves hang well horizontal.
Stems are grey-white and are usually 35-47 centimetres in diameter.
The 1 m inflorescences bear white male and female flowers.
The rachis is pinnately divided and ranges from 3.2 to 5.8 m long.
Stems often are swollen and bulging along portions of their length, which may reflect years where growing conditions were better or worse than average.

Roystonea lenis is a large palm which reaches heights of 20 m. Stems are grey-white and are usually 35 - in diameter.
Leaf , root.
The leaf base forms a distinctive green sheath around the uppermost portion of the trunk.
Stem color ranges from gray-white to gray-brown except in R. violacea , which have violet-brown or mauve stems.
Leaf scars are often prominent along the stem, especially in young, rapidly growing individuals.

Trunk gray-white, to 20 m. tall, 35-47 cm.
The upper portion of the stem is encircled by leaf sheaths, forming a green portion known as the crownshaft which is normally 2 m long.
Some species so closely resemble one another that scientific differentiation is by inflorescence detail, flower size, colour, etc.

Trunk gray-white, to 20 m tall, 35-47 cm diam.
Stem columnar, variously tapered or swollen, tan, grey, or white, ringed by prominent or obscure leaf scars.
Individuals have about 15 leaves with 0.2 - petioles and 4 - rachises, the leaves hang well horizontal.
Fruits ellipsoid, 11.3-14 mm long, 9.2-11.2 mm dorsiventralthickness, and 8.8-11.1 mm wide, epicarp black, stigmatic scar plain, endocarp spheroid to ellipsoid, hard and durable, 9.1-12.2 mm long, 7-9.2 mm dorsiventral thickness, and 7.4-8.6 mm wide, seed dorsi ventrally compressed spheroid, 7.9-9.9 mm long, 5.6-6.7 mm dorsiventral thickness, and 6.6-7.7 mm wide, raphe circular.
The stems, which were compared to stone columns by Louis and Elizabeth Agassiz in 1868, are smooth and columnar, although the trunks of R. altissima and R. maisiana are more slender than those of typical royal palms.

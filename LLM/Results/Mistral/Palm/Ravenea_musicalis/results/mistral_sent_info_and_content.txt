We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Ravenea musicalis.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Fourteen to 16 pinnate fronds emerge from the crown of the tree.
This seed is brown before germination and has a seed coat that is 0.2 mm thick.
Rank: GERMINATING.
The unbranched stem can be 30 - 40cm in diameter, it is topped by a crown of 14 - 16 leaves that can be up to 1.8 metres long.
Mature R. musicalis ranges from 2.5 to 8 meters tall.
The bottle-shaped trunk tapers down, with the broadest diameter of about 0.5 meters occurring at water level.
The fruits are orange and the single seed within is covered by a hard, black seed coat.
Trunk height: 2.5 - 8 m. Around 14 - 16 arching leaves stretch out from the crown and each support 59 - 63 stiff leaflets on either side of the leaf axis, giving the frond a feather-like appearance.
The leaves have a tubular sheath at the base that is orange on the underside with thin, grey, tomentum.
The leaves are abaxially keeled with a glossy texture, and leaflets always occur within a single plane on either side of the rachis.
The leaves are up to 2-5 m long, pinnately compound, reduplicate, erect at first then arching, twisted near the apex, with numerous crowded narrow ribbed leaflets.
It has symmetrical leaves and develops an attractive swollen base of the trunk.
Pistillate inflorescences are solitary and branch to 1 order.
They have been reported to reach up to 1.8 meters in length and have between 59 and 63 stiff leaflets, though the variation within the species can be considerable.
The fruits of R. musicalis are orange and round, about 14-23 mm in diameter.
It is a very large palm with a large, untidy crown.
Ravenea musicalis starts its life submerged in shallow flowing water and eventually produces a thick gray trunk topped by an open crown of lax, elegantly arching, pinnate leaves.
They are small to large, dioecious palms, with solitary, robust grey stems, swollen at base and gradually tapering upward.
Within each fruit is a single seed that begins to germinate while still inside the fruit.
It has orange fruit and a single hard black seed.
Once germinated, the seeds develop a seed leaf that is hooked in shape.
A single brown seed, which germinates within the fruit, is 10-14 mm across with a hard, black seed coat.
The trunk is relatively short and is swollen, particularly at the base.
Morphology Mature R. musicalis ranges from 2.5 to 8 meters tall.
Very Moist.
The inflorescence is short, borne among the leaves, the fruit is a red drupe.
Ravenea musicalis is a single-stemmed, evergreen palm tree growing up to 8 metres tall.
Staminate inflorescences occur in multiples of 5 and branch to 1 order.
Small to medium-sized ventricose palm growing in 0.5-2.5 m deep water.
The fruit containing the germinated seed splits easily with slight disturbance.
It is a solitary, dioecious, medium sized palm in which the trunk is relatively short.and swollen, particularly at the base, and it has between 14 to 16 arching, pinnate leaves.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

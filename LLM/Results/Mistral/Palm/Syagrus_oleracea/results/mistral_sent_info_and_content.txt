We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Syagrus oleracea.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The inflorescences are unbranched or branch once, a single hybrid, S.
Syagrus romanzoffiana Glassman is a heliophilous.species, selective hygrophilous and pioneer and has reaches 10-20 meters.in height, and stipe with 20-30 cm in diameter and drupe type globular.and oval-shape fruits with yellowish-orange pulp when ripe, fleshy and.sweet.
The leaves of all but one species, S. smithii , are pinnately compound.
It always intrigued me with its very longilinear leaflets.
When the vigorous seeds stain slowly, they present shining pink.surface coloration.
Native to tropical America, the stems of Syagrus oleracea reaches the 20 m of height with 20-30 cm of diameter.
The conidiophores were macronematous, erect, oblong, branched, 1 to 5 septate, and 75.0 to 120.0 x 1.90 to 3.20 Î¼m.
It has large leaves up to 3 meters long and flowers that appear in clusters during the spring until the autumn.
S. romanzoffiana seeds present germination of tubular remote type.
Página. inicial.
They are monoecious , with both male and female flowers borne in the same inflorescence.

Primary root of length equal to or greater than the largest.seed measure.
The stems are normally spineless, but some species have spiny leaf sheaths or spines.
Habit : solitary with a crown of 8-15 plumose leaves.
Thin, tall, smooth ringed trunk and plumose long arching leaves.
The Syagrus oleracea Becc. is a monoecious unarmed species with solitary stem, erect, columnar, slightly enlarged at the base, 15-20 m tall and of 20-30 cm of diameter, of greyish white color, slightly marked by the annular scars of the junction of the fallen leaves and vertically fissured, covered for short under the foliage by the residues of the foliar bases.
Has large seed for a Syagrus.
The transition from the leaf sheath to the petiole can be gradual and difficult to identify, but in species where they can be distinguished, leaf sheaths are 2.5-180 cm long and the petioles are 0-30 cm.
The fruit are drupes, which vary in colour from green to orange to brown.
Rank: FLOWERING.
Ovoid fruits, 4-6 cm long and of 3-4 cm of diameter, of yellowish green color, containing only one ovoid seed 3-5 cm long and of 2-2,5 cm of diameter.
x lacerdamourae , occasionally shows second-order branching, and emerge from between the leaves.
Normal seedling, pr) primary root.
The solitary, columnar tree reaches up to 20 meters in height.
Inflorescence : 1.5' long, arching and pendent.
This elegant species has a tall, slender trunk and arched, feathery leaves.
Trunk : single, 6"-8" thick, whitish, ringed, sometimes a few un-split leaf bases are retained near the top of the trunk.
Nosso Face.
S. romanzoffiana Glassman fruits presented average length.of 2.44 cm and 2.20 cm in diameter and seeds , 2.34 cm in.length and 1.42 cm in diameter.
The cotyledonary cleft is conspicuous and the protoderm is.unstratified, formed by flattened cells of easily identifiable.
Those species that have upright trunks grow 2-36 metres tall with stems that are 6-35 centimetres in diameter.
The first symptoms appear as small, yellow, hydrotic flecks on young or mature leaves that evolve to necrotic brown streaks that run parallel to the leaf veins.
The plumule of the embryonic axis is differentiated in two leaf.primordia, constituted by the first and second leaf sheath.
Spacing: 8-10 ft. 10-12 ft.
Fruit : oblong, 2" long, yellow-green when ripe.
They range in size from 1.2 to 1.9 cm in length, and 0.7 to 4.5 cm in diameter.
The inflorescences, on a 20-50 cm long peduncle, generate among the leaves, 40-90 cm long, of yellow colour, initially enclosed in a woody spathe of brown color, with ramifications of first order and unisexual flowers arranged in triads , excepting in the terminal part of the rachillae where are present only male flowers solitary or in couple.
The mean seed size is 2.34 cm in length and 1.42 cm in.diameter.
The leaves, 2-3,5 m long, are pinnate, slightly arcuate, with 90-160 pairs of linear leaflets with acuminate apex, rigid, arranged on the rachis in groups of 2-5 on various angles, 30-60 cm long and 2,5-4 cm broad, of dark green color above, glaucous green below, foliar bases and petiole, 0,5-1,5 m long, with fibrous margins.
Petiole/Leaf bases : 6" long, unarmed, flat on top, dull green, un-split leaf, wide leaf bases sometimes retained for a year or two.
Palms in this genus usually have solitary stems, clustered stems are less common, and a few are stolon -like subterranean.
Seeds were considered to be.germinated when primary root reached a length equal to or greater than.the highest seed size, Figure 2.
Leaf Description : pinnate, plumose with a marked variation in the planes of the leaflets, arching, medium grey green to dull, yellow green, 8'-9' long, new leaflets fairly stiff, but older ones tend to droop.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

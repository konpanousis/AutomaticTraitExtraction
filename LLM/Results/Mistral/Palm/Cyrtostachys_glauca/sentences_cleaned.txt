Solitary or clustering, moderate to robust, unarmed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
Fruits 1-seeded, broad to narrow-ellipsoidal or sickle-shaped, usually black, the perianth whorls persistent, stigmatic remains apical, epicarp smooth, contrasting with rachilla, mesocarp thin, closely adhering to the seed, pericarp anatomy: combination of papillate epidermis, heavy layer of tanniniferous/pigmented cells below the epidermis, a system of vascular bundles with thick fibrous sheaths with purely fibrous bundles frequently above and below, absence of brachysclereids, and a very thin sclerified locular epidermis.

Rank: SEEDLING.
Leaves pinnate, neatly abscising, sheath tubular, forming a well defined crownshaft, brilliantly orange-red coloured in one species , glabrous or scaly, rachis like the petiole but angled adaxially, leaflets always single-fold, acute or acuminate or sometimes rounded with a bifid tip, regularly arranged or grouped with two leaflets in one species , often stiff, sometimes slightly paler beneath, ± glabrous adaxially, abaxially often with ramenta along mid vein and sometimes minutely dotted between the veins, transverse veinlets conspicuous or obscure.
The pits are very shallow, or even lacking in a few specimens, and together with the tiny flowers , the species may be superficially confused, with Heterospathe or Rhopaloblaste.

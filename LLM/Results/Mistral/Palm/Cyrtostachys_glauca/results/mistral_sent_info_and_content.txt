We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Cyrtostachys glauca.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Slender to moderate, clustering tree palm to 5.5 - 15 m, withup to c. 3 adult stems andup to4ormore suckers at base, crown spherical in outline.
Staminate flowers with 3, distinct, imbricate, broad, strongly keeled sepals with minutely toothed margins , petals about twice as long as sepals, united at the very base to ca.
The tallest main stem was carrying an inflorescence, but it was difficult to photograph from the ground and not much in the way of detail could be discerned.
Stems erect, bare, conspicuously ringed with leaf scars, often bearing a mass of adventitious roots at the base, where clustering, the clump rather close, or more rarely diffusely spreading by stolons.
Solitary or clustering, moderate to robust, unarmed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
Fruits 1-seeded, broad to narrow-ellipsoidal or sickle-shaped, usually black, the perianth whorls persistent, stigmatic remains apical, epicarp smooth, contrasting with rachilla, mesocarp thin, closely adhering to the seed, pericarp anatomy: combination of papillate epidermis, heavy layer of tanniniferous/pigmented cells below the epidermis, a system of vascular bundles with thick fibrous sheaths with purely fibrous bundles frequently above and below, absence of brachysclereids, and a very thin sclerified locular epidermis.
Stem 5 - 15 cm in diam., bright green and becoming grey in age, nodal scars conspicuous, internodes 3.5 - 7.5 cm long.
Germination adjacent-ligular, eophyll bifid shaped, connate basally, apically inflexed in bud, anthers apically and basally with narrow lobes.
Solitary or clustered, moderate to very robust pinnate-leaved palms of West Malesia and New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, with conspicuous crownshafts, inflorescences with short peduncles and flowers generally borne in pits, fruits have apical stigmatic remains.
Stem 5 - 15 cm diam., bright green and becoming grey in age, nodal scars conspicuous, internodes 3.5 - 7.5 cm long.
Fruits 9 - 12 x 4 - 6 mm, ellipsoid to sickle-shaped, green to black, beak 1 - 4 mm long.
Stem erect, bare, conspicuously ringed with leaf scars, often bearing a mass of adventitious roots at the base, where clustering, the clump rather close, or more diffusely spreading by stolons.
Slender to moderate, clustering palm to 5.5 - 15 m, withup to about 3 adult stems and up to 4 or more suckers at base, crown spherical in outline.
Rank: SEEDLING.
Leaves pinnate, neatly abscising, sheath tubular, forming a well defined crownshaft, brilliantly orange-red coloured in one species , glabrous or scaly, rachis like the petiole but angled adaxially, leaflets always single-fold, acute or acuminate or sometimes rounded with a bifid tip, regularly arranged or grouped with two leaflets in one species , often stiff, sometimes slightly paler beneath, ± glabrous adaxially, abaxially often with ramenta along mid vein and sometimes minutely dotted between the veins, transverse veinlets conspicuous or obscure.
The pits are very shallow, or even lacking in a few specimens, and together with the tiny flowers , the species may be superficially confused, with Heterospathe or Rhopaloblaste.
A slender, clustering palm for tropical regions.
Pistillate flowers about same size as or slightly larger than the staminate, sepals 3, distinct, rounded, imbricate, the margins minutely toothed, petals 3, slightly larger than sepals, distinct, imbricate, proximally asymmetrical, rounded with short triangular valvate tips, staminodal ring membranous, very low, bearing short truncate or irregularly triangular teeth, gynoecium unilocular, ellipsoidal with 3 short recurved stigmas, ovule pendulous from apex of locule, form unknown.
Individuals can grow to 21.6 m.
Solitary or clustered, moderate to tall, unarmed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
Cyrtostachys glauca H. E. Moore.Spezies erkannt von EOL Dynamic Hierarchy 0.9 and GBIF classification.
Rank: FLOWERING.
Pistillate flowers about the same size as or slightly larger than the staminate, sepals 3, distinct, rounded, imbricate, the margins minutely toothed , petals 3, slightly larger than the sepals, distinct, imbricate proximally, asymmetrical, rounded with short triangular valvate tips, staminodal ring membranous, very low, bearing short truncate or irregularly triangular teeth, gynoecium unilocular, ellipsoidal with 3 short recurved stigmas, ovule pendulous from the apex of the locule, form unknown.
Seed globose or ellipsoidal, apically attached, the hilum orbicular, endosperm homogenous, embryo basal-Germination adjacent-ligular, eophyll bifid with narrow lobes.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.
Fruit 1-seeded, broad to narrow-ellipsoidal, usually black, the perianth whorls persistent, stigmatic remains apical, epicarp smooth, contrasting with the rachilla, mesocarp thin, oily, with abundant longitudinal fibre bundles, endocarp thin, closely adhering to the seed.
Slender to moderate, clustering tree palm to 5.5 - 15 m, with up to c. 3 adult stems and up to 4 or more suckers at base, crown spherical in outline.
Stem 5 - 15 cm diam., bright green and becoming grey in age, nodal scars conspicuous, internodes 3.5 - 7.5 cm long.
The colorful trunks are smooth and very glossy and the crownshafts are a perfect shade of orange-yellow.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

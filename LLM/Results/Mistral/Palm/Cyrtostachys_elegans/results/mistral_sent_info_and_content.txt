We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Cyrtostachys elegans.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Rank: GERMINATING.
Staminate flowers with 3, distinct, imbricate, broad, strongly keeled sepals with minutely toothed margins , petals about twice as long as sepals, united at the very base to ca.
Decals & Skins.
The tallest main stem was carrying an inflorescence, but it was difficult to photograph from the ground and not much in the way of detail could be discerned.
Stems erect, bare, conspicuously ringed with leaf scars, often bearing a mass of adventitious roots at the base, where clustering, the clump rather close, or more rarely diffusely spreading by stolons.
Belly Rings.
Robust, clustering tree palm to 15 m, with up to c. 3 adult stems and 4 - 6 or more suckers at the base, crown hemispherical in outline.
Solitary or clustering, moderate to robust, unarmed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
Fruits 12 - 17 x 5 - 6 mm, ellipsoid to sickle-shaped, green to black , beak 1 - 2 mm long, perianth persistent, forming a narrow cylinder at the base or leaving a different coloured scar, â
A very prominent, bright green crownshaft holds a crown of spreading leaves with somewhat drooping leaflets.
Fruits 1-seeded, broad to narrow-ellipsoidal or sickle-shaped, usually black, the perianth whorls persistent, stigmatic remains apical, epicarp smooth, contrasting with rachilla, mesocarp thin, closely adhering to the seed, pericarp anatomy: combination of papillate epidermis, heavy layer of tanniniferous/pigmented cells below the epidermis, a system of vascular bundles with thick fibrous sheaths with purely fibrous bundles frequently above and below, absence of brachysclereids, and a very thin sclerified locular epidermis.
Germination adjacent-ligular, eophyll bifid shaped, connate basally, apically inflexed in bud, anthers apically and basally with narrow lobes.
Solitary or clustered, moderate to very robust pinnate-leaved palms of West Malesia and New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, with conspicuous crownshafts, inflorescences with short peduncles and flowers generally borne in pits, fruits have apical stigmatic remains.
All Rings.
A rare, moderate-sized palm from rainforests on New Guinea that forms sparsely but tightly clustering, slender, smooth, green trunks to about 6 m tall.
Seeds 6 - 7 x 4 - 5 x 4 mm, ellipsoid, rounded apical and flatted basally.
Stem erect, bare, conspicuously ringed with leaf scars, often bearing a mass of adventitious roots at the base, where clustering, the clump rather close, or more diffusely spreading by stolons.
Stem 15 - 30 cm diam., greyish green apically, greyish brown to black near base, internodes c. 25 cm long.
Rank: SEEDLING.
Leaves pinnate, neatly abscising, sheath tubular, forming a well defined crownshaft, brilliantly orange-red coloured in one species , glabrous or scaly, rachis like the petiole but angled adaxially, leaflets always single-fold, acute or acuminate or sometimes rounded with a bifid tip, regularly arranged or grouped with two leaflets in one species , often stiff, sometimes slightly paler beneath, ± glabrous adaxially, abaxially often with ramenta along mid vein and sometimes minutely dotted between the veins, transverse veinlets conspicuous or obscure.
.Around 2013-2014, I began to notice the orange-pink-reddish coloration on the petioles and as the main stem thickened, it to started to develop some of this same coloration.
Pistillate flowers about same size as or slightly larger than the staminate, sepals 3, distinct, rounded, imbricate, the margins minutely toothed, petals 3, slightly larger than sepals, distinct, imbricate, proximally asymmetrical, rounded with short triangular valvate tips, staminodal ring membranous, very low, bearing short truncate or irregularly triangular teeth, gynoecium unilocular, ellipsoidal with 3 short recurved stigmas, ovule pendulous from apex of locule, form unknown.
Individuals can grow to 20 m.
Fruits 12 - 17 x 5 - 6 mm, ellipsoid to sickle-shaped, green to black , beak 1 - 2 mm long, perianth persistent, forming a narrow cylinder at the base or leaving a different coloured scar, â
Solitary or clustered, moderate to tall, unarmed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
Rank: FLOWERING.
A medium sized clumping palm, to about 6m,.with a very prominant green crownshaft.
The small palm was a healthy, dark green and had a main stem and maybe 3-5 suckers.
Pistillate flowers about the same size as or slightly larger than the staminate, sepals 3, distinct, rounded, imbricate, the margins minutely toothed , petals 3, slightly larger than the sepals, distinct, imbricate proximally, asymmetrical, rounded with short triangular valvate tips, staminodal ring membranous, very low, bearing short truncate or irregularly triangular teeth, gynoecium unilocular, ellipsoidal with 3 short recurved stigmas, ovule pendulous from the apex of the locule, form unknown.
Cyrtostachys elegans: foto de semilla puesta a germinar hace 3 meses.
Seed globose or ellipsoidal, apically attached, the hilum orbicular, endosperm homogenous, embryo basal-Germination adjacent-ligular, eophyll bifid with narrow lobes.
Stem 15 - 30 cm in diam., greyish green apically, greyish brown to black near base, internodes about 25 cm long.
Still looks good under canopy.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.
Stem 15 - 30 cm diam., greyish green apically, greyish brown to black near base, internodes c. 25 cm long.
Fruit 1-seeded, broad to narrow-ellipsoidal, usually black, the perianth whorls persistent, stigmatic remains apical, epicarp smooth, contrasting with the rachilla, mesocarp thin, oily, with abundant longitudinal fibre bundles, endocarp thin, closely adhering to the seed.
The colorful trunks are smooth and very glossy and the crownshafts are a perfect shade of orange-yellow.
Spacing: 10-12 ft.
Robust, clustering tree palmto 15 m, with up to c. 3 adult stems and 4 - 6 or more suckers at the base, crown hemispherical in outline.
Robust, clustering palm to 15 m, with up to 3 adult stems, and 4 - 6 or more suckers at the base, crown hemispherical in outline.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

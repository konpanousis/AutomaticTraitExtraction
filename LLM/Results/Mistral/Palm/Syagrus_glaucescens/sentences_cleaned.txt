The inflorescences are unbranched or branch once, a single hybrid, S.
A clumping Jube.
The leaves of all but one species, S. smithii , are pinnately compound.
The leaflets are also unique in that they are very short and rounded at the ends, in alternate planes and very stiff.
Rank: GERMINATING.
Spacing: 36-48 in.
It grows to 4-10m tall, with 8-20 leaves to 2m long.
Emasculated inflorescence protected in a plastic bag,waiting for anthesis.
The first pic shows the flower spike.
They are monoecious , with both male and female flowers borne in the same inflorescence.
Solitary palm, 4-7 m tall.
They are only 6 inches tall
A bit concerned as it has a yellowish look
Definitely looks different than a typical butiagrus.
Stem 17-22 cm diam., covered with leaf base remains in the younger part, vertically spiraling rows.
It is an erect shrub with smooth bark, hairy young branchlets, lance-shaped leaves with the narrower end towards the base, and yellow flowers.
S. x serroana trunk detail.
Rank: SEEDLING.
The stems are normally spineless, but some species have spiny leaf sheaths or spines.
Detail of leaflets, underside.
Usually most of the male flowers are on the upper end of the inflorescence.
Usually pollenated the receptive flowers 3 or 4 times over the few days that the female flowers are receptive.
The fronds are flat, rigid so far.
Look how white it is when old leaf bases fall off too.
The transition from the leaf sheath to the petiole can be gradual and difficult to identify, but in species where they can be distinguished, leaf sheaths are 2.5-180 cm long and the petioles are 0-30 cm.
The fruit are drupes, which vary in colour from green to orange to brown.
Yes, very slow growing.
The beautifull spiraling trunk and the very stiff silvery dark green leaflets resemble somewhat a cycad.
An unusual palm, with a slender, solitary trunk.which has stiff, glaucous, slightly plumose,.upwards pointing leaves that grow in five ranks.
Rank: FLOWERING.
x lacerdamourae , occasionally shows second-order branching, and emerge from between the leaves.
It's leaves are very stiff to the touch ala coronata, with a slight waxy blue on undersides.
The seeds on the B x S.glaucescens are 2/3 to 1/3 the size of normal eriospatha seeds and this is a clear sign of hybrid seeds.
Leaves little arched, 2.5-3 m long, dark green, bright, leaflets 115-120 per side, rigid, irregularly arranged, inserted in 3 or 4 planes.
They are a light green color, very lax in appearance and the leaflets all lay in one plane.
It is a very small, extremely slow growing plant and very old plants reach maybe 4-5' tall and have hundreds or extremely closely spaced leaf scars.
Those species that have upright trunks grow 2-36 metres tall with stems that are 6-35 centimetres in diameter.
The leaves are bent at the end, with very hairy margins near the trunk, and consist of 180-320 slightly coiled leaflets irregularly arranged in several planes on the rake.
They range in size from 1.2 to 1.9 cm in length, and 0.7 to 4.5 cm in diameter.
The pollen was sifted ,collected in an envelop.
The fruit are oval, greenish-yellow, 6–9 cm long.
The second pic shows the large, drooping Basal leaflets.
Palms in this genus usually have solitary stems, clustered stems are less common, and a few are stolon -like subterranean.

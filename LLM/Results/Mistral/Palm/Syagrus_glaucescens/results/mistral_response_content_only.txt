Note: The evidence value '1' indicates strong evidence for the value in the input text while '0' indicates no strong evidence found. The values for "Fruit size" and "Fruit shape" were inferred based on the descriptions of the fruit in the input text. For example, the fruit is described as "oval" and "greenish-yellow, 6-9 cm long", which suggests that it is large and ovoid in shape. The values for "Crown" and "Conspicuousness" were set to '0' for all possible values since there was no strong evidence found in the input text for any of these traits.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Syagrus glaucescens.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The inflorescences are unbranched or branch once, a single hybrid, S.
A clumping Jube.
The leaves of all but one species, S. smithii , are pinnately compound.
The leaflets are also unique in that they are very short and rounded at the ends, in alternate planes and very stiff.
Rank: GERMINATING.
Spacing: 36-48 in.
It grows to 4-10m tall, with 8-20 leaves to 2m long.
Emasculated inflorescence protected in a plastic bag,waiting for anthesis.
The first pic shows the flower spike.
They are monoecious , with both male and female flowers borne in the same inflorescence.
Solitary palm, 4-7 m tall.
They are only 6 inches tall
A bit concerned as it has a yellowish look
Definitely looks different than a typical butiagrus.
Stem 17-22 cm diam., covered with leaf base remains in the younger part, vertically spiraling rows.
It is an erect shrub with smooth bark, hairy young branchlets, lance-shaped leaves with the narrower end towards the base, and yellow flowers.
S. x serroana trunk detail.
Rank: SEEDLING.
The stems are normally spineless, but some species have spiny leaf sheaths or spines.
Detail of leaflets, underside.
Usually most of the male flowers are on the upper end of the inflorescence.
Usually pollenated the receptive flowers 3 or 4 times over the few days that the female flowers are receptive.
The fronds are flat, rigid so far.
Look how white it is when old leaf bases fall off too.
The transition from the leaf sheath to the petiole can be gradual and difficult to identify, but in species where they can be distinguished, leaf sheaths are 2.5-180 cm long and the petioles are 0-30 cm.
The fruit are drupes, which vary in colour from green to orange to brown.
Yes, very slow growing.
The beautifull spiraling trunk and the very stiff silvery dark green leaflets resemble somewhat a cycad.
An unusual palm, with a slender, solitary trunk.which has stiff, glaucous, slightly plumose,.upwards pointing leaves that grow in five ranks.
Rank: FLOWERING.
x lacerdamourae , occasionally shows second-order branching, and emerge from between the leaves.
It's leaves are very stiff to the touch ala coronata, with a slight waxy blue on undersides.
The seeds on the B x S.glaucescens are 2/3 to 1/3 the size of normal eriospatha seeds and this is a clear sign of hybrid seeds.
Leaves little arched, 2.5-3 m long, dark green, bright, leaflets 115-120 per side, rigid, irregularly arranged, inserted in 3 or 4 planes.
They are a light green color, very lax in appearance and the leaflets all lay in one plane.
It is a very small, extremely slow growing plant and very old plants reach maybe 4-5' tall and have hundreds or extremely closely spaced leaf scars.
Those species that have upright trunks grow 2-36 metres tall with stems that are 6-35 centimetres in diameter.
The leaves are bent at the end, with very hairy margins near the trunk, and consist of 180-320 slightly coiled leaflets irregularly arranged in several planes on the rake.
They range in size from 1.2 to 1.9 cm in length, and 0.7 to 4.5 cm in diameter.
The pollen was sifted ,collected in an envelop.
The fruit are oval, greenish-yellow, 6–9 cm long.
The second pic shows the large, drooping Basal leaflets.
Palms in this genus usually have solitary stems, clustered stems are less common, and a few are stolon -like subterranean.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

Note: The evidence value '1' indicates strong evidence for the value in the input text while '0' indicates no strong evidence found. The values for "Fruit size" and "Fruit shape" were inferred based on the descriptions of the fruit in the input text. For example, the fruit is described as "oval" and "greenish-yellow, 6-9 cm long", which suggests that it is large and ovoid in shape. The values for "Crown" and "Conspicuousness" were set to '0' for all possible values since there was no strong evidence found in the input text for any of these traits.

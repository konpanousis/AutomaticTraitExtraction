We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Astrocaryum javarense.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Extremely spiny pinnate-leaved palms from Central and South America, distinctive in the marked separation of pistillate flowers from the staminate part of the rachilla.
Chelyocarpus is a genus of small to medium-sized fan palms which are native to northwestern South America.
The royal palm reaches heights from 50 to over 80 feet tall.

There are about 26 species in the genus, ranging in size from understorey shrubs with subterranean stems to subcanopy trees as tall as 20 metres.
It grows up 35 m tall and can have leaves or fronds 10–12 m long.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.
Pistillate flower very much larger than the staminate, calyx urn-shaped or cup-shaped, truncate or shallowly 3-lobed, sometimes bearing numerous short spicules, usually densely tomentose, corolla not, briefly, or considerably exceeding, and similar to the calyx, or composed of 3 imbricate triangular lobes, connate basally, staminodes 6, epipetalous near the base of the corolla, connate into a low membranous ring or tooth-like, gynoecium varied in shape, trilocular, triovulate, the 3 large fleshy erect, or head-like, reflexed stigmas borne on a beak, protruding through the mouth of the corolla tube, sometimes bearing short spines and/or tomentum, ovule ?
Palm Traits 1.0.3.5
Staminate flowers small, ± symmetrical, sepals 3, very small, ± triangular, ?
Stems, leaves and sometimes even the fruit are covered with spines.
Moderate to robust, solitary or clustered, sometimes acaulescent, spiny, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
Fruit 1-seeded with apical stigmatic remains, beaked, spherical, top-shaped, prismatic, or ovoid, often brightly coloured, brown, yellowish or orange-red, calyx and corolla persistent, enlarged and irregularly splitting, epicarp spiny or unarmed, tomentose or glabrous, mesocarp relatively thin, fleshy or dry and starchy, and fibrous, sometimes with the epicarp irregularly splitting and spreading to expose the endocarp, endocarp thick, stony, with numerous flattened, black longitudinal fibres on the surface, conspicuously radiating from the 3 subterminal pores.
This pinnately leaved, non-spiny genus includes both small palms lacking an aboveground stem and large trees.
Seed irregularly globular, basally attached, hilum circular, raphe branches anastomosing, endosperm homogeneous, usually hollow, embryo subapical, opposite one of the endocarp pores.
Most species are small trees about 2 m tall, but some are large trees while others are shrubs with subterranean stems.
They are pleonanthic—they flower repeatedly over the course of their lifespan—and monoecious , meaning that there are separate male and female flowers, but individuals plants bear both types of flowers.

Palm Traits 1.0.5.7
Stem very short to tall, often slender, obscured by leaf bases, or becoming bare and conspicuously ringed with leaf scars, often armed with fierce spines pointing in several directions, sometimes losing spines with age.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

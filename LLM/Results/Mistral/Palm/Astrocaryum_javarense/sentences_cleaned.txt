Pistillate flower very much larger than the staminate, calyx urn-shaped or cup-shaped, truncate or shallowly 3-lobed, sometimes bearing numerous short spicules, usually densely tomentose, corolla not, briefly, or considerably exceeding, and similar to the calyx, or composed of 3 imbricate triangular lobes, connate basally, staminodes 6, epipetalous near the base of the corolla, connate into a low membranous ring or tooth-like, gynoecium varied in shape, trilocular, triovulate, the 3 large fleshy erect, or head-like, reflexed stigmas borne on a beak, protruding through the mouth of the corolla tube, sometimes bearing short spines and/or tomentum, ovule ?

Staminate flowers small, ± symmetrical, sepals 3, very small, ± triangular, ?
Stems, leaves and sometimes even the fruit are covered with spines.
Moderate to robust, solitary or clustered, sometimes acaulescent, spiny, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
Fruit 1-seeded with apical stigmatic remains, beaked, spherical, top-shaped, prismatic, or ovoid, often brightly coloured, brown, yellowish or orange-red, calyx and corolla persistent, enlarged and irregularly splitting, epicarp spiny or unarmed, tomentose or glabrous, mesocarp relatively thin, fleshy or dry and starchy, and fibrous, sometimes with the epicarp irregularly splitting and spreading to expose the endocarp, endocarp thick, stony, with numerous flattened, black longitudinal fibres on the surface, conspicuously radiating from the 3 subterminal pores.
This pinnately leaved, non-spiny genus includes both small palms lacking an aboveground stem and large trees.
Seed irregularly globular, basally attached, hilum circular, raphe branches anastomosing, endosperm homogeneous, usually hollow, embryo subapical, opposite one of the endocarp pores.
Most species are small trees about 2 m tall, but some are large trees while others are shrubs with subterranean stems.
They are pleonanthic—they flower repeatedly over the course of their lifespan—and monoecious , meaning that there are separate male and female flowers, but individuals plants bear both types of flowers.

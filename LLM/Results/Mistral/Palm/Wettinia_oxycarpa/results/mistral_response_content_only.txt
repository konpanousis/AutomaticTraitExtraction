Note: The binary values in the output dictionary are based on the presence of strong evidence for each value in the input text. For example, the value "bluish" is associated with a binary value of 1 for the "Fruit colour description" trait, indicating that there is strong evidence for this value in the input text ("The fruit is small to medium-sized and elongated, green to bluish black in color."). However, the value "blue" is associated with a binary value of 0 for the "Fruit colour" trait, indicating that there is no strong evidence for this value in the input text.

For example, the value "bluish" is associated with a binary value of 1 for the "Fruit colour description" trait, indicating that there is strong evidence for this value in the input text ("The fruit is small to medium-sized and elongated, green to bluish black in color."). However, the value "blue" is associated with a binary value of 0 for the "Fruit colour" trait, indicating that there is no strong evidence for this value in the input text.', name=None, tool_calls=None), finish_reason=<FinishReason.stop: 'stop'>)] usage=UsageInfo(prompt_tokens=1005, total_tokens=1493, completion_tokens=488)

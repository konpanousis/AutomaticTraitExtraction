Small dioecious unarmed palms, mostly arundinaceous with slender ringed or jointed canes or trunks: leaves pinnate, pinnatisect or pinnately veined, minute flowers of differing morphology not distinctly sunken in the rachis or only appar- ently so when crowded, the peduncles bearing few or several sheathing bracts or spathes that may fall or become shredded before fruiting and leave scars or rings that are marks of the genus: spadices inter- or infrafoliar: perianth-parts in two series of 3 each but variously connate and sometimes each series united into one body, stamens 6, often connate: fruit small, hard or thinly succulent only on the exterior, ellipsoid, oblong, somewhat pyriform, stigma basal, seed single, albumen plane.
Stem: 5-12 mm diam., green, shining, ringed, internodes 2.57 cm long, aerial roots basally.
Some features of floral anatomy, including vascularisation of the ovule by a strand from each ventral bundle and abundant raphides in styles and stigmas, are characteristic of other genera in Chamaedoreeae and Ceroxyleae.
Germination adjacent-ligular, eophyll bifid or pinnate.
General Information Plants small, usually low-growing, unarmed.
Generally rather small, often clustering, pinnate-leaved dioecious palms from the undergrowth of rain forest from Mexico southwards to South America, very diverse and with a wide range of habits including one climbing species, inflorescence and flower form equally varied.
Chamedorea oblongata.
Fruit small, globose or oblong, stigmatic remains basal, epicarp smooth, mesocarp fleshy, endocarp thin.
Flowers unisexual, sessile, staminate and pistillate flowers on different plants.
Staminate flowers symmetrical, sepals 3, entire, united basally or distinct, petals 3, distinct or variously connate, lobes valvate, stamens 6, filaments short, broad or awl-shaped, anthers dorsifixed, included, oblong or didymous, pistillode various, cylindric or expanded basally, sometimes trilobed.
Seed erect, globose, or ellipsoidal, hilum small, basal, branches of raphe obscure, endosperm cartilaginous, embryo basal to subapical.

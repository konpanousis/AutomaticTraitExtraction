We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Chamaedorea lucidifrons.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:

General Information Slender, 2.5 m. tall: leaf-blade 40-50 cm.
The leaves are pinnate , with one to numerous leaflets.
Pistillate with rachis to 7 cm long, ± straight, up to 11 rachillae, these to 20 em long, drooping in flower, pendulous and orange in fruit.
Habit: solitary , erect, to 2 m tall.
Staminate with rachis to 10 cm long, straight, up to 17 rachillae, these to 30 cm long, slender, pendulous.
Pistillate emerging from bare stem well below the leaves, peduncle to 60 cm long, slender, 1-1.5 cm wide at base, erect, bracts 6-8, tightly sheathing, brownish and ± splitting in fruit, rachis 2-4 cm long, branched portion 22 cm long and nearly as broad, rachillae 7-11, these 10-25 cm long, slender, I mm diam., simple, glabrous, upwardly s-curved, flexuous, orange in fruit.
Inflorescences: infrafoliar, attached well below the leaves, peduncles to 75 em long, 7-8 mm diam., erect, ± robust, bracts 5-6, prophyll to 3 cm long, 2nd bract to 10 em, 3rd to 25 cm, 4th to 40 cm, 5th to 35 cm, 6th to 30 cm, tubular, acuminate, fibrous, longitudinally striate-nerved.
Leaves: 4-5, spreading, pinnate, sheath green with no pale stripe extending onto rachis below, petiole to 35 cm long, robust, rachis to 66 cm long, pinnae 3-8 on each side of rachis, to 45 x 9 cm, broadly lanceolate, sigmoid, falcate, acuminate, thin-papery, 6-10 primary nerves prominent and elevated above, I secondary between each of 2 primaries, tertiaries numerous, faint, primaries paler below, end pair of pinnae sometimes very large, then each lobe to 50 x 30 cm on a rachis 40 cm long with 30 primary nerves on each side, outer margin remotely toothed toward apex.
They are small palms, growing to 0.3-6 m tall with slender, cane-like stems, growing in the understory in rainforests , and often spreading by means of underground runners , forming clonal colonies.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

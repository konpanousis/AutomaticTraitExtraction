We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Ravenea xerophila.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

The Ravenea xerophila Jum. is a dioecious species, solitary, unarmed, with erect stem, up to about 8 m tall and of 30 cm of diameter that narrows when getting close to the top, thickly covered in the youngest part by the residues of the foliar bases, wrinkled and greyish in the oldest part.
The foliar base, 40-50 cm long, open on the side opposite to the petiole, is covered by a brown tomentum below, by a white waxy patina above.

Rank: SEEDLING.
Solitary medium-sized palm.
It is a very large palm with a large, untidy crown.
Arbres à fruits comestibles.
It is an unusual palm in that it has a huge carrot-like root, similar to that of a cycad, but a small, grass-like leaf structure above ground.
Globose fruits, of 2-2,5 cm of diameter, or bi- trilobed, yellow when ripe, containing 1-3 seeds.
The last emerging leaf snapped off.
They are small to large, dioecious palms, with solitary, robust grey stems, swollen at base and gradually tapering upward.
Leaf Description : pinnate, 10' long, very upright orientation with markedly recurved last 1/3-1/4 of the leaf, sea green to pale blue-green.
Rank: FLOWERING.
Inflorescences between the leaves , the male ones, up to about 60 cm long, with ramifications of first order and solitary flowers with trilobed calyx, 3 petals merged at the base and 6 stamens.
Petiole/Leaf bases : 3' long, nearly a 'V' in cross section, though not as deeply channeled as that, unarmed save for some scurf, but fairly sharp edges, covered with thin layer of powder tomentum giving the appearance of baby blue petioles, petioles appear to shooting out of the ground for the first 15 years or more.
The leaves are a blue-green color and markedly arched or recurved.
Trees grow from 1.5-8 meters in height, and 13-30 cm in diameter.
The inflorescence is short, borne among the leaves, the fruit is a red drupe.
Trunking palms have skirts of retained leaves with r.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

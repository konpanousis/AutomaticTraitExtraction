The length of the rachilla is given above as 2.5 cm long.
Leaf petioles 8.7 cm long, rachises 21.7 cm long, 2.4 mm wide, the spines usually >1 cm long, mostly adaxial or lateral, straight with briefly swollen bases, pinnae 5 per side of rachis, with long, filiform apices, without a beard of spines at the bases, with uneven surfaces at the bases adaxially, usually covered with spinules and/or dense tomentum, basal pinna 14.2 cm long, 3.7 cm wide, cirri absent, the rachis terminating beyond the distalmost, opposite pair of pinnae in a <1 cm long ?stub?, this with an easily broken, longer, smooth, brown extension.
Plants 1.3 m tall, stems 0.7 cm diameter, clustered.
Fruit 1-seeded, ± ovoid or spherical, bright red, deep purple, or black, with apical stigmatic remains, epicarp smooth, mesocarp thin, fleshy, endocarp stony with 3 pores slightly distal to the equator.
Most species are small trees about 2 metres tall, but some are large trees while others are shrubs with subterranean stems.
Stem covered with leaf sheaths, eventually becoming bare, with long internodes and conspicuous nodal scars, the first stem slender, not usually reaching a great height before being replaced by more robust sucker shoots.
They have simple or pinnately compound leaves and yellow, orange, red or purple-black fruit.
Chelyocarpus is a genus of small to medium-sized fan palms which are native to northwestern South America.
Plants flower repeatedly over the course of their lifespan and have separate male and female flowers, although these are borne together on the same inflorescence.
Desmoncus polyacanthos , the jacitara palm , is a spiny, climbing palm native to the southern Caribbean and tropical South America.
Slender, clustering , spiny, pleonanthic, monoecious climbing palms.
Desmoncus leaves are pinnately compound and are made up of a leaf sheath , petioles , rachis , and individual leaflets.
Most have pinnately compound leaves , one species has entire leaves.
Palm 1.3 m tall, stems 0.7 cm in diameter, clustering.
Clustering spiny climbing palms of Central and South America, with reflexed acanthophylls borne on a whip at the end of the leaf.
Leaf petioles 8.7 cm long, rachises 21.7 cm long, 2.4 mm wide, the spines usually >1 cm long, mostly adaxial or lateral, straight with briefly swollen bases, pinnae 5 per side of rachis, with long, filiform apices, without a beard of spines at the bases, with uneven surfaces at the bases adaxially, usually covered with spinules and/or dense tomentum, basal pinna 14.2 cm long, 3.7 cm wide, cirri absent, the rachis terminating beyond the distalmost, opposite pair of pinnae in a <1 cm long ?
There are about 26 species in the genus, ranging in size from understorey shrubs with subterranean stems to subcanopy trees as tall as 20 metres.
Mauritiella is a dioecious genus of flowering plant in the palm family found in South America where it is commonly called buriti.
Germination adjacent-ligular, eophyll bifid with rather broad, acute segments or pinnate.
Inflorescences rachis absent , peduncles 2.3 mm wide, peduncular bracts 14.4 cm long, narrow, ribbed, densely whitish-brown tomentose, not spiny, rachillae 1, brown tomentose initially, 2.5 cm long, 1.6 mm wide, stamens 6, fruits 13.3 mm long, 10.5 mm wide, the surfaces uneven with numerous, subepidermal, short, often branching fibers, fruiting corollas less than one quarter as long as fruits, splitting irregularly into 3 lobes, the lobes often splitting again, endocarps globose to obovoid with rounded or slightly peaked apices, the pores lateral.
Petioles, rachis, cirrus and peduncular bracts are covered with short, curved spines.
Stems grow clustered together, and are 2–12 m long and 0.5–2 cm in diameter.
Stems, leaves and sometimes even the fruit are covered with spines.
Bactris campestris is a small spiny palm which grows in multi-stemmed clumps in savannas and low forests in northern South America from Colombia to the Guianas, Trinidad and Tobago, and northern Brazil.
Seed ovoid, with 3 surface hollows, basally attached, hilum basal, circular, raphe branches densely anastomosing, endosperm homogeneous, embryo lateral.
The ends of the leaves are modified into a climbing structure called a cirrus.

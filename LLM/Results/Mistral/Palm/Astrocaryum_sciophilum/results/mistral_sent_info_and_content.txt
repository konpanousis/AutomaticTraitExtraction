We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Astrocaryum sciophilum.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Most palms are distinguished by their large, compound, evergreen leaves, known as fronds, arranged at the top of an unbranched stem.
The genus includes solitary or caespitose species in the following classes: large palms with tall stem, palms with large leaves and medium-sized, or short, or subterranean stem, slender to medium-sized palms, acaulescent palms with very short leaves.
It grows up to 15 m tall and is usually solitary.
Astrocaryum is a genus of spiny palms with pinnately compound leaves-rows of leaflets emerge on either side of the axis of the leaf in a feather-like or fern-like pattern.
They have simple or pinnately compound leaves and yellow, orange, red or purple-black fruit.

Chelyocarpus is a genus of small to medium-sized fan palms which are native to northwestern South America.
The royal palm reaches heights from 50 to over 80 feet tall.
Plants flower repeatedly over the course of their lifespan and have separate male and female flowers, although these are borne together on the same inflorescence.
Most have pinnately compound leaves , one species has entire leaves.

Astrocaryum is a genus of about 36 to 40 species of palms native to Central and South America and Trinidad.
Categories : Astrocaryum Arecaceae genera Neotropical realm flora Cocoseae stubs Hidden categories: Articles with short description Short description is different from Wikidata Articles with 'species' microformats All stub articles.
There are about 26 species in the genus, ranging in size from understorey shrubs with subterranean stems to subcanopy trees as tall as 20 metres.
It grows up 35 m tall and can have leaves or fronds 10–12 m long.
Stems, leaves and sometimes even the fruit are covered with spines.
This pinnately leaved, non-spiny genus includes both small palms lacking an aboveground stem and large trees.
Most species are small trees about 2 m tall, but some are large trees while others are shrubs with subterranean stems.
They are pleonanthic—they flower repeatedly over the course of their lifespan—and monoecious , meaning that there are separate male and female flowers, but individuals plants bear both types of flowers.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Lytocaryum hoehnei.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Palms once classified as Microcoelum are herein included, the genus is closely related to Syagrus, from which it is differentiated only by abundant tomentum, strongly versatile anthers, and slight epicarp, mesocarp, and endocarp differences.
Seeds on the left are without endocarp.
Rank: GERMINATING.
Leaves 16-22 in the crown, pinnate and Â± straight, about 1.3 m long, leaflets 1.5-2.0 cm in width.
Spacing: 6-8 ft. 8-10 ft.
Palms once classified as Microcoelum are herein included, the genus is closely related to Syagrus , from which it is differentiated only by abundant tomentum , strongly versatile anthers , and slight epicarp , mesocarp , and endocarp differences.
The inflorescence is interfoliar and once branched, covered in brown hair, monoecious.
It has a slender trunk that can reach about 5 m tall, topped by a crown of elegant, feathery leaves.
The trunks reach 15 cm in diameter to 5 m in height, but are usually just half that in cultivation.
Definitie: whole plant growth form.
Rank: SEEDLING.
Solitary, pinnate palm, closely ringed and retain leaf sheaths at the top of the stem.
The fruit is globose to ellipsoidal, pink to red, with one seed.
The pinnae are 12 cm long, closely and regularly arranged along the rachis, in the same plane, green on top with gray, glaucous undersides.
The spherical leaf crown consists of numerous pinnate leaves to 75 cm long on hairy, 30 cm petioles.
Rank: FLOWERING.
The pinnae are 12 cm long, closely and regularly arranged along the rachis, in the same plane, green on top with gray, glaucous undersides.
Identification: Stem 1-4 m tall and about 10 cm in diameter.
The female flowers are twice as big as the male's, both with three sepals and three petals.
Fruits ovoid, 3-3.3 cm long, pale green to yellowish green and dehiscing at maturity.
Definitie: An autotroph which is capable of transforming light into chemical energy.
The trunks reach 15 cm in diameter to 4.5 m in height, but are usually just half that in cultivation.
The inflorescence is interfoliar and once branched, covered in brown hair, with unisexual flowers of both sexes.
The spherical leaf crown consists of numerous pinnate leaves to 75 cm long on hairy, 30 cm petioles.
And leaf #7 is going pinnate on both sides of the blade.
The leaflets are distinclty wider than in L. weddellianum and the seeds have a harder shell, more like a Syagrus.
.First partly pinnate leaves appearing on my hoehnei seedlings.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

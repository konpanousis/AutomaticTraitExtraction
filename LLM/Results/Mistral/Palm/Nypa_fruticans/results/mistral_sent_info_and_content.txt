We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Nypa fruticans.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Mature Nipah palms may grow as high as 10m tall.
Similar to the female flowers, the Nipah fruits are arranged in a spherical bunch that can be 30-45cm in diameter.

Female inflorescence is stout, 1 meter high or less.
The leaves extend up to 9 m in height.
Fruit is globose, nodding, up to 30 centimeters in diameter.

Each shoot has a tuft of 3-5 leaves at any time, the leaves erect, 4.5-14.2 m long, simply pinnate, petiole very stout, up to 1.5 m long, channeled adaxially, terete distally, dilated towards the base into a short sheath, leaflets up to 163 per leaf, linear, single-fold, 1.2-1.5 m x 6.5-8.6 cm, coriaceous, midrib bearing appressed brown scales on lower surface.

The stem, procumbent or underground, with prominent foliar scars, reaches 45-50 cm of diameter and ramifies dichotomously Â© Giuseppe Mazza.
Stem prostrate or subterranean , up to 45 cm in diameter, branching dichotomously at regular intervals, with curved leaf scars above, and roots along the underside.
Only the leaves project upwards
The leaves, long overall 5-12 m, are paripinnate, erect or slightly arcuate, with 50-100 pairs of linear-lanceolate leaflets with acuminate apex, 0,6-1,3 m long and 5-8,5 cm broad, coriaceous, regularly arranged along the rachis on the same level, of glossy dark green color above and covered by a thin waxy layer below, the robust petiole, grooved above and of brown color, is 0,4-1,5 m long.

Description A globular flower cluster on a nipa palm.
Thus, it is an unusual tree, and the leaves can extend up to 9 m in height.
Within each fruit, an egg-shaped seed with soft, edible endosperm  is contained.
The leaf bases overlap below ground, although these may be exposed by erosion of the substrate over time.

Rank: SEEDLING.
The flower produces woody nuts arranged in a globular cluster up to 25 cm across on a single stalk.
Infructescences formed by a globose mass, of 25-50 cm of diameter, of fruits developing from only one of the three carpels, interspersed by the carpellary residues and by fruits not completely developed.
A globular fruit cluster of the nipa palm.
Leaflets are numerous, rigid, lanceolate, up to 1 meter long,.
In very young seedlings the leaves are arranged distichously but later they become arranged spirally.
Palmer saltgrass, NyPa Wild Wheat Perennial 0.4.
The flower yields a woody nut, these arranged in a cluster compressed into a ball up to 25 cm across on a single stalk.
Leaves are at the ends of the rootstocks, large, rosette.
Male inflorescence is brown, erect, up to 1 meter high.

The seedling is prostrate first, but after being attached to the substrate, the plumule becomes erect and additional adventitious roots arise from the lower part of the stem.
Each stiff, erect leaf may extend up to 9m long.
At first, up to eight bladeless sheaths develop per plant, followed by the first juvenile foliage leaves 3-6 months after germination.
The inflorescence are  dimorphic  - the female flowers are arranged into a round, golf-sized ball at the tip of the central stalk, while the much smaller male flowers are closely packed into a club-shaped spike branching from the central stalk.
About 1 year after germination the rhizome starts branching dichotomously and a new shoot develops vegetatively on each branch.
During early growth the stem grows obliquely downwards until it is about 1 m deep in the ground.
Female flowers, 1-1,3 cm long, with 3 free carpels, of greenish yellow color, that mature before the male ones , favoring the crossed fecundation.
The flowers are a globular inflorescence of female flowers at the tip with catkin -like red or yellow male flowers on the lower branches.
These yellow  inflorescence arise from sturdy 1m long stalks from the base of the palm.
The jejunum was everted and cut into 5-cm segments.
Inflorescences solitary between the leaves , 0,8-1,8 m long, bearing at the apex of the rachis a globose mass of female flowers, of 4-8 cm of diameter, with on the side several ramifications ending in rachillae bearing the male flowers, about 8 cm long, above the female inflorescence.
It differs from other palms in the lack of an upright stem, instead it has underground horizontal stem, known as rhizome, that branches  dichotomously.
Aquatic Perennial Seed propagated Vegetatively propagated Woody.
These leaflets may be 60 to 130cm long and numerous in number at 30 to 40 leaflets per leaf.
The fruits mature in 5-9 months.
Numerous male flowers, in close contact, sessile, solitary, about 4 mm long, with 3 stamens with the filaments merged in a column, of yellowish color.
Obovoid fruits, angular with irregular longitudinal grooves due to the mutual compression, 8-15 cm long and of 5-9 cm of diameter, woody, of glossy brown colour with fibrous mesocarp, containing only one globose seed, of about 5 cm of length and diameter.

Ripe Seed Polar Fractions.
A bunch of Nipah fruit drooping due to its weight.
Each angular fruit is fibrous and chestnut-brown, ranging from 10-15cm long and 5-8cm wide.
The inflorescence of this palm is globose and comprised of female flowers at the tip and male flowers at the lower branches.

Erect shoots arise from each rhizome branch.
The trunk can reach up to 45 cm in diameter and the leaves can each be up to 6 m long.
Green leaves of palm isolated on white background.
The flower produces woody nuts arranged in a globular cluster up to 25 cm across on a single stalk.
Nipa is a monoecious palm, with stout, subterranean, trunkless and thornless.
Seed broadly ovoid, grooved adaxially, hilum basal, endosperm homogeneous.
The leaves extend up to 9 m in height.
It differs from most palm in the lack of an upright stem, trunkless, developing inflorescences at 1 meter height.
The flowers are a globular inflorescence of female flowers at the tip with catkin-like red or yellow male flowers on the lower branches.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Synechanthus fibrosus.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

The rachis is elongated bearing slender rachillae with slender, spinelike tips.
The leaf undersides and rhachis has an unusual bluish/violet color.
Cold Hardiness: 26-28ºs F. Trunk type: Single trunk, very thin trunk.
Leaves few, glossy deep-green, sheath and petiole together to 1.1 m. long or more, the sheath tubular and the petiole short on new leaves but the sheath soon splitting opposite the petiole, functioning as and differentiated from the petiole only by the deeply channelled upper surface and a narrow, usually fibrous strip along the margin, petiole convex below, concave above, rachis convex below, angled above, ca.
It is a solitary pinnate palm from Central America where it can grow up to.
Spacing: 4-6 ft. 6-8 ft.
Leaves reduplicately pinnate, sheath elongate on new leaves but soon splitting opposite the petiole and differentiated from it only by a narrow, usually fibrous, dry strip along each margin, petiole circular in cross-section, rachis angled adaxially, rounded abaxially, leaflets broadly reduplicate at insertion, acute to acuminate, slightly to markedly sigmoid

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

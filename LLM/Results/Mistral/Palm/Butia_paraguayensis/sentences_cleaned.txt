The surface is covered in minute 2Î¼m-large reticulate patterns.
Pinnate leaves, long at the most, up to about 2,5 metres, greatly and elegantly bent, with rigid leaflets of a blue-green colour, regularly disposed on the rachis, forming a V, the petiole is thorny on the margins.

A bit concerned as it has a yellowish look
In common with B. yatay with which it shares some of the same range, the female flowers are much larger than the male.
I've noticed that these are rather wispy at a young age, but the leaflets seem to get denser as they mature.
Very diminutive plants.
Rank: SEEDLING.
The 6 to 20 arched pinnate leaves range from a glaucous to dark-green and the petiole margins are covered in fibres and a row of spines up to 4 cm long.

The fruit are 3-4 x 2-3 cm, juicy, slightly fibrous, taste sweet-sour, with a persistent perianth base and 1-3 large nuts with homogeneous endosperm.
Rank: FLOWERING.
The leaves are very curved.

Fruit 1-3-seeded, spherical, oblate, or ovoid, yellow, brown, or purplish, with a short to long beak and apical stigmatic remains, epicarp smooth, mesocarp thin to thick, pulpy or fleshy, sometimes sweet, fibrous, endocarp thick, bony, with 1-3 developed cavities, the pores lateral below the equator or subbasal.
.Blue form.
Stem subterranean to erect, generally not tall, obscured by remains of leaf bases, eventually becoming bare, marked with close leaf scars.
Plant capacity without perfilhar, Acaulescentes adult plants or stems of up to 2 meters, an extended section of the bract peduncle 40-60 cm long, rachis inflorescence with 13-30 cm.

Small to moderate, solitary or clustered pinnate-leaved palms, native to cooler parts of south America, the petioles are usually with toothed margins, the staminate flowers have 6 stamens and the endosperm is homogeneous.
Seed basally attached, conforming to the shape of the endocarp cavities, endosperm homogeneous, solid, embryo opposite the endocarp pore.
It has blueish to sliver green recurving pinnate leaves also only having a single trunk and will only reach up to 2 meters in height.
The fronds are twisted.
Leaves pinnate, small to large, arching, sheaths tubular at first, disintegrating into a fibrous network, often densely tomentose, petiole short to long, channelled or flat adaxially, rounded or angled abaxially, proximally unarmed and bearing scattered fibres or armed with coarse spines decreasing in size distally until represented by short teeth, variously caducously scaly or glabrous, often glaucous, rachis usually curved, adaxially angled or flattened, rounded or flattened abaxially, leaflets single-fold, usually numerous, regularly arranged, held stiffly in the same plane, linear, acuminate, acute, obtuse or asymmetrical at the tips, frequently glaucous, usually with crowded ramenta on the abaxial surface of the main vein near the rachis, transverse veinlets obscure.
Last pic : new opened inflorescence and a few fruits forming on an older infructescence.
This one shows little purple female flowers.
After he cut them off he discovered there were two immature fruit on the inflorescence.
It has flowers emerging now.
Leaves are large, grey and come from the.ground, and are typicaly lying on the ground.
The fruit are variable and may be shaped conical or ovoid, as well as being coloured green, purple, red, orange or yellow at maturity.
More like kind off thickened fibers, not real spines on mine.
It is a very variable plant in the wild, the trunk, solitary, is generally subterranean or very short, but it can reach the 3-4 m in particularly propitious conditions , and a diameter varying from 10 to 20 cm, covered by the residues of.the foliar petioles.
The seedlings. grow slowly, with 4.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Syagrus picrophylla.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The inflorescences are unbranched or branch once, a single hybrid, S.
It is a medium-sized Syagrus and produces a sturdy but only about 7 m tall trunk that holds a compact crown of slightly arching, plumose leaves with rigid leaflets.
The leaves of all but one species, S. smithii , are pinnately compound.
Spacing: 36-48 in.
Syagrus picrophylla - a pretty & compact Palm.
.Solitary, robust tree palm, to 10 m tall.
Staminate flowers in distal two-fifths of rachilla, 11 x 11 mm, white, pistillate flowers in proximal three-fifths of rachilla, 8 x 7 mm.
Trunk 30 cm diam., flared or slightly.enlarged at base, ringed, internodes 3-10 cm.
They are monoecious , with both male and female flowers borne in the same inflorescence.
Fruit 3-3.2 x 3 cm, ovoid, orange.
Definitie: whole plant growth form.
The palm behind the Thrinax.
The stems are normally spineless, but some species have spiny leaf sheaths or spines.
The leaves, on short petiole, are pinnate, 2,5-3,2 m long, with 90-160 pairs of linear leaflets with acuminate apex, rigid, irregularly arranged on the rachis in groups of 2-4 on slightly different angles, in the median part 40-60 cm long and 2,5-3,5 cm broad, of intense green colour above, pale bellow, the foliar base, 1-1,5 m long, of green colour, has fibrous margins.
Inflorescences on a 40-60 cm long peduncle, between the leaves, 60-80 cm long, of yellowish cream colour, initially enclosed in a woody spathe of orange colour, with ramifications of first order and unisexual flowers arranged in triads , but in the terminal part of the rachillae where are present only solitary or coupled male flowers.
The transition from the leaf sheath to the petiole can be gradual and difficult to identify, but in species where they can be distinguished, leaf sheaths are 2.5-180 cm long and the petioles are 0-30 cm.
Its leaves arranged in five, distinct, vertically spiraling rows and trunk leaf scars are similar to those of S. coronata, and it has the.appearance of a very robust form of this.species.
The fruit are drupes, which vary in colour from green to orange to brown.
Rank: FLOWERING.
x lacerdamourae , occasionally shows second-order branching, and emerge from between the leaves.
Full Sun Sun to Partial Shade Foliage: Evergreen Foliage Color: Unknown - Tell us Height: 15-20 ft. 20-30 ft. 30-40 ft.
Medium sized, solitary palm with a smooth, slender trunk.with a distinctive swollen base, with long arching, slightly plumose leaves,.and long, thin leaflets.
Rodr. is an unarmed monoecious species with erect stem, columnar, enlarged at the base, 3-7 m tall and of 15-25 cm of diameter, greyish with prominent annular scars at the the junction of the fallen leaves, but for a short space under the crown where is covered by the residues of the foliar bases.
This is a close up of the trunk, about 6 inches 15 cm across.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.
Those species that have upright trunks grow 2-36 metres tall with stems that are 6-35 centimetres in diameter.
Palm Traits 1.0.3.5
Ellipsoidal fruits, 3,5-4,2 cm long and of 2,5-3 cm of diameter, of orange brown colour when ripe and epicarp and mesocarp often divided in three parts at the apex, containing only one ellipsoidal seed 1,5-2 cm long and of about 1,5 cm of diameter.
Definitie: An autotroph which is capable of transforming light into chemical energy.
They range in size from 1.2 to 1.9 cm in length, and 0.7 to 4.5 cm in diameter.
Medium sized, solitary palm with a smooth slender trunk, a distinctive swollen base, with long arching, slightly plumose leaves, and long, thin leaflets.
But this species has relatively straight, only slightly arching leaves, and the leaflets are also stiffer and wider than in the common queen palm.
It looks like it has some P. speciosa color in it, but the fronds are more upright and smaller and the new shoots seem to be pink.
Palms in this genus usually have solitary stems, clustered stems are less common, and a few are stolon -like subterranean.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

I have set the binary number to 1 for the following values:

* "orange" in "Fruit colour description" and "Fruit colour" traits, because the input text mentions "fruit 3-3.2 x 3 cm, ovoid, orange".
* "ovoid" in "Fruit shape" trait, because the input text mentions "Fruit 3-3.2 x 3 cm, ovoid, orange".
* "ellipsoid" in "Fruit shape" trait, because the input text mentions "Ellipsoidal fruits, 3,5-4,2 cm long and of 2,5-3 cm of diameter, of orange brown colour when ripe and epicarp and mesocarp often divided in three parts at the apex, containing only one ellipsoidal seed 1,5-2 cm long and of about 1,5 cm of diameter".

I have set the binary number to 0 for all other values, as I am not 100% sure about their association with the input text. Note that I have not added any new trait values or modified the initial ones.

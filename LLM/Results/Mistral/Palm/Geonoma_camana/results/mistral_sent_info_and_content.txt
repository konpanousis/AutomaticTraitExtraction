We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Geonoma camana.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Fruit ±globose, sometimes somewhat pointed, green, brown, or purple-black, 1-seeded, stigmatic remains basal, the rachillae often becoming brightly coloured, epicarp, thin smooth, mesocarp thin, with narrow longitudinal fibres, endocarp thin, crustaceous to membranous.
Pistillate flowers sunken in the pit with only the tips of the floral organs exserted, sepals 3, united basally and adnate to the receptacle, often keeled, free and imbricate distally, petals 3, connate in a soft tube, briefly adnate to receptacle basally, ending in 3, valvate, chaffy, spreading lobes, staminodes united in a tube, truncate, 6-toothed or 6-lobed, lobes, if present, spreading at anthesis, tubes basally adnate to the receptacle, and sometimes also the corolla tube, gynoecium tricarpellate but 2 carpels vestigial at anthesis, unilocular, uniovulate, ovule anatropous, style tubular, lateral to basal, elongate, ending in 3 linear stigmas, recurved at anthesis.
Extremely variable genus of mostly rather small solitary or clustering palms from rain forest in Central and South America, with distinctive anthers with divergent thecae.
Plants 2.0 m tall, stems 0.5 m tall, 2.3 cm in diameter, solitary, not cane-like, internodes 0.6 cm long, not scaly.
Small to moderate, solitary or clustered, unarmed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
Seed ± globose, hilum short, basal, raphe encircling the seed, endosperm homogeneous, embryo erect basal.
Definitie: whole plant growth form.

Geonoma is a genus of small to medium-sized palms native to the forest understorey of tropical Central and South America.
Leaves 9 per stem, irregularly pinnate or regularly pinnate and the pinnae with 1 main vein only, not plicate, the bases of blades running diagonally into the rachis, sheaths 19.2 cm long, petioles 71.0 cm long, drying green or yellowish, rachis 83.1 cm long, 5.7 mm in diameter, veins not raised or slightly raised and triangular in cross-section adaxially, pinnae 17 per side of rachis, basal pinna 30.5 cm long, 4.3 cm wide, forming an angle of 53° with the rachis, apical pinna 19.9 cm long, 12.6 cm wide, forming an angle of 44° with the rachis.
Leaves pinnate, regularly or irregularly divided, or entire and bifid, sheath short, splitting opposite the petiole, margins fibrous, glabrous or variously tomentose, petiole short to long, slightly grooved or flattened adaxially, rounded abaxially, glabrous or tomentose, blade bifid, or with 2 or 3 pairs of leaflets, or irregularly divided, or nearly evenly pinnate, thin and papery or somewhat leathery, usually glabrous adaxially, glabrous, tomentose or with scales abaxially, especially along the main ribs, uniseriate hairs present or absent, midribs of single folds conspicuous, transverse veinlets not evident.
Pollen ellipsoidal, usually with either slight or obvious asymmetry, aperture a distal sulcus, ectexine tectate, coarsely perforate or perforate and/or micro-channelled, and rugulate, aperture margin usually slightly finer, infratectum columellate, longest axis 22-48 µm.
Individuals can grow to 2 m.
From east to west, specimens become smaller.
Stem very short, subterranean, erect, or creeping, slender, sometimes tall, enclosed by thin leaf sheaths, becoming bare, usually cane-like, ringed with close or distant, conspicuous or inconspicuous leaf scars.
Individuals can grow to 17 m.
Squared multiple R for the regression of plant height on longitude is 0.36, stem height 0.24, petiole length 0.40, rachis width 0.54, basal pinna length 0.31, basal pinna angle 0.12, apical pinna length 0.50, apical pinna width 0.10, apical pinna angle 0.19, peduncle width 0.25, rachilla length 0.19, and rachilla width 0.18.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.
Definitie: An autotroph which is capable of transforming light into chemical energy.
Shrub, Subshrub, Solitary palm.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

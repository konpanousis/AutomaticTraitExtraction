Fruit ±globose, sometimes somewhat pointed, green, brown, or purple-black, 1-seeded, stigmatic remains basal, the rachillae often becoming brightly coloured, epicarp, thin smooth, mesocarp thin, with narrow longitudinal fibres, endocarp thin, crustaceous to membranous.
Pistillate flowers sunken in the pit with only the tips of the floral organs exserted, sepals 3, united basally and adnate to the receptacle, often keeled, free and imbricate distally, petals 3, connate in a soft tube, briefly adnate to receptacle basally, ending in 3, valvate, chaffy, spreading lobes, staminodes united in a tube, truncate, 6-toothed or 6-lobed, lobes, if present, spreading at anthesis, tubes basally adnate to the receptacle, and sometimes also the corolla tube, gynoecium tricarpellate but 2 carpels vestigial at anthesis, unilocular, uniovulate, ovule anatropous, style tubular, lateral to basal, elongate, ending in 3 linear stigmas, recurved at anthesis.

Geonoma is a genus of small to medium-sized palms native to the forest understorey of tropical Central and South America.
Leaves 9 per stem, irregularly pinnate or regularly pinnate and the pinnae with 1 main vein only, not plicate, the bases of blades running diagonally into the rachis, sheaths 19.2 cm long, petioles 71.0 cm long, drying green or yellowish, rachis 83.1 cm long, 5.7 mm in diameter, veins not raised or slightly raised and triangular in cross-section adaxially, pinnae 17 per side of rachis, basal pinna 30.5 cm long, 4.3 cm wide, forming an angle of 53° with the rachis, apical pinna 19.9 cm long, 12.6 cm wide, forming an angle of 44° with the rachis.
Leaves pinnate, regularly or irregularly divided, or entire and bifid, sheath short, splitting opposite the petiole, margins fibrous, glabrous or variously tomentose, petiole short to long, slightly grooved or flattened adaxially, rounded abaxially, glabrous or tomentose, blade bifid, or with 2 or 3 pairs of leaflets, or irregularly divided, or nearly evenly pinnate, thin and papery or somewhat leathery, usually glabrous adaxially, glabrous, tomentose or with scales abaxially, especially along the main ribs, uniseriate hairs present or absent, midribs of single folds conspicuous, transverse veinlets not evident.
Pollen ellipsoidal, usually with either slight or obvious asymmetry, aperture a distal sulcus, ectexine tectate, coarsely perforate or perforate and/or micro-channelled, and rugulate, aperture margin usually slightly finer, infratectum columellate, longest axis 22-48 µm.
Individuals can grow to 2 m.
From east to west, specimens become smaller.
Stem very short, subterranean, erect, or creeping, slender, sometimes tall, enclosed by thin leaf sheaths, becoming bare, usually cane-like, ringed with close or distant, conspicuous or inconspicuous leaf scars.
Individuals can grow to 17 m.

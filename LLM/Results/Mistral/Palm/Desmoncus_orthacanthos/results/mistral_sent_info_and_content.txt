We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Desmoncus orthacanthos.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
This is a potentially tall and very spiny, sprawling, climbing palm that has very 'un-palm-like' leaflets.
Habit : clustering with a crown of 10-30 pinnate leaves per stem.
Stems, leaf sheaths and often leaves are covered with black spines up to 6 cm long.
Leaves are 3-6' long and end in a hook.
Stems, leaf sheaths and often leaves are covered with black spines up to 6 cm long.
Fruits red, elongate, 1.5-2 cm long.
Tall, slender-stemmed, pinnate-leaved palm native to Central and South America and Trinidad and Tobago.
Petiole/Leaf bases : nonexistent.
Fruit 1-seeded, ± ovoid or spherical, bright red, deep purple, or black, with apical stigmatic remains, epicarp smooth, mesocarp thin, fleshy, endocarp stony with 3 pores slightly distal to the equator.
Leaf Description : pinnate, short, ovoid leaflets in clusters of 2-4 along rachis, 5'-6' long, bright green, long black spines along underside of rachis, leaf tips have backwards, stiff, shortened leaflets that act like 'grappling hooks'.
Stem covered with leaf sheaths, eventually becoming bare, with long internodes and conspicuous nodal scars, the first stem slender, not usually reaching a great height before being replaced by more robust sucker shoots.
Leaves 1.5-2 m long, the axis with numerous black, slender spines, distally often unarmed but with a number of pinnae modified into climbing hooks, pinnae to 25 on each side, more or less evenly spaced, narrowly elliptic, to 20 cm long and 2-5 cm wide.
Fruit : spherical to elipsoid, 3/4" long, yellow-orange to red when ripe.
Like all Desmoncus, the leaflets are ovoid and have a wavy appearance.
Inflorescence 30-40 cm long, with 20-50 branches.

Wikipedia Desmoncus polyacanthos Spiny, climbing palm native to the southern Caribbean and tropical South America.
Inflorescence : among leaves, spiny spathe.
Trunk : multiple, 1'2"-3/4" in diameter, sparsely ringed, intensely spiny with 1/2"-2" black to gray, stiff, very sharp spines, dull to olive green in color.
Germination adjacent-ligular, eophyll bifid with rather broad, acute segments or pinnate.
Stems grow clustered together, and are 2-12 m long and 1.5-2 cm in diameter.

Stems grow clustered together, and are 2-12 m long and 1.5-2 cm in diameter.
Plants 2.6 m tall, stems 1.3 cm diameter, clustered.
Seed ovoid, with 3 surface hollows, basally attached, hilum basal, circular, raphe branches densely anastomosing, endosperm homogeneous, embryo lateral.
Pollen ellipsoidal, usually with slight asymmetry, aperture a distal sulcus, ectexine tectate, finely perforate, perforate and micro-channelled, and rugulate, aperture margin may be slightly finer, infratectum columellate, longest axis 19-41 µm.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

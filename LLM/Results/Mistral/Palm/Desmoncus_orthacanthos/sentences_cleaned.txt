This is a potentially tall and very spiny, sprawling, climbing palm that has very 'un-palm-like' leaflets.
Habit : clustering with a crown of 10-30 pinnate leaves per stem.
Stems, leaf sheaths and often leaves are covered with black spines up to 6 cm long.
Leaves are 3-6' long and end in a hook.
Stems, leaf sheaths and often leaves are covered with black spines up to 6 cm long.
Fruits red, elongate, 1.5-2 cm long.
Tall, slender-stemmed, pinnate-leaved palm native to Central and South America and Trinidad and Tobago.
Petiole/Leaf bases : nonexistent.
Fruit 1-seeded, ± ovoid or spherical, bright red, deep purple, or black, with apical stigmatic remains, epicarp smooth, mesocarp thin, fleshy, endocarp stony with 3 pores slightly distal to the equator.
Leaf Description : pinnate, short, ovoid leaflets in clusters of 2-4 along rachis, 5'-6' long, bright green, long black spines along underside of rachis, leaf tips have backwards, stiff, shortened leaflets that act like 'grappling hooks'.
Stem covered with leaf sheaths, eventually becoming bare, with long internodes and conspicuous nodal scars, the first stem slender, not usually reaching a great height before being replaced by more robust sucker shoots.
Leaves 1.5-2 m long, the axis with numerous black, slender spines, distally often unarmed but with a number of pinnae modified into climbing hooks, pinnae to 25 on each side, more or less evenly spaced, narrowly elliptic, to 20 cm long and 2-5 cm wide.
Fruit : spherical to elipsoid, 3/4" long, yellow-orange to red when ripe.
Like all Desmoncus, the leaflets are ovoid and have a wavy appearance.
Inflorescence 30-40 cm long, with 20-50 branches.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Chamaedorea deneversiana.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The flowers are produced in inflorescences , they are dioecious , with male and female flowers on separate plants.
The fruit is an orange or red drupe 0.5-2 cm diameter.
Stem: 1.3-1.6 cm diam., smooth, green, ringed, internodes 5-12 cm long, rooting along its length Leaves: 4, spreading, bifid, rarely pinnate, sheath 19-26 cm long, obliquely open apically, green, petiole 15-45 cm long, ± flat and green above, rounded, rough, and gray-green below, rachis 35-60 cm long, angled and gray-green above, rounded, rough, and gray-green below, yellowish below when dry, blade 50-80 x 12-25 cm, oblong, incised apically 1/5-1/4 its length, bright glossy green, margins coarsely toothed toward apex, rarely with few small basal pinnae, 20-24 primary nerves on each side of rachis, these sharply angled above, slender, sigmoid, prominent below, ± erose-margined.
Staminate with peduncle 40 cm long, erect, bracts 6, rachis 5 cm long, slightly flexuous, rachillae 10, these 25-33 cm long, drooping.
Pistillate with peduncle 18-60 cm long, erect, bracts 5-6, rachis 2-3 cm long, slightly flexuous, orange in fruit, rachillae 3-6, these 10-30 cm long, drooping and yellow to orange in fruit.
Leaves erect, bluish metallic green, blade simple 60-80 cm long, 25-30 cm wide.
Inflorescences: infrafoliar, borne well below the leaves.
Fruits: 6.8-7.5 x 5.6-5.8 mm, broadly ellipsoid, green to yellow.
Habit: solitary, decumbent to erect, 1.5-3 m tall.
Stem to 2 m tall, 1.5-2.5 cm in diameter, often with adventitious roots on the proximal nodes.
The leaves are pinnate , with one to numerous leaflets.
Fruits elliptic, 10-15 mm long, black.
Inflorescences one per node, infrafoliar, often borne close to the base of the stem, 35-40 cm long, branches 5-10, to 10 cm long, those of female inflorescences becoming red in fruit.
Flowers: Staminate 1.1-1.3 x 1.8-1.9 mm, calyx 0.3-0.4 mm high, lobed, sepals connate in basal 1/2, petals valvate in bud, apparently free at anthesis, nerveless or obscurely nerved, stamens with anthers 0.6 mm long, ± reniform, pistillode 0.4 mm high, stout, anvil-shaped.
Shrub, Subshrub, Solitary palm.
Pistillate 2.2-2.5 mm long, suburceolate, calyx 0.5-0.6 x 2.5-2.8 mm, lobed, nerved, sepals connate and/or imbricate basally, petals obscurely nerved externally, prominently 15-nerved within, constricted toward base where connate in a tube 0.2-0.3 mm high, staminodes lacking, pistil 1.5-1.9 mm long, styles short, stigma lobes separated.
They are small palms, growing to 0.3-6 m tall with slender, cane-like stems, growing in the understory in rainforests , and often spreading by means of underground runners , forming clonal colonies.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

Pistillate with peduncle 18-60 cm long, erect, bracts 5-6, rachis 2-3 cm long, slightly flexuous, orange in fruit, rachillae 3-6, these 10-30 cm long, drooping and yellow to orange in fruit.
Leaves erect, bluish metallic green, blade simple 60-80 cm long, 25-30 cm wide.
Inflorescences: infrafoliar, borne well below the leaves.
Fruits: 6.8-7.5 x 5.6-5.8 mm, broadly ellipsoid, green to yellow.
Habit: solitary, decumbent to erect, 1.5-3 m tall.
Stem to 2 m tall, 1.5-2.5 cm in diameter, often with adventitious roots on the proximal nodes.
The leaves are pinnate , with one to numerous leaflets.
Fruits elliptic, 10-15 mm long, black.
Inflorescences one per node, infrafoliar, often borne close to the base of the stem, 35-40 cm long, branches 5-10, to 10 cm long, those of female inflorescences becoming red in fruit.
Flowers: Staminate 1.1-1.3 x 1.8-1.9 mm, calyx 0.3-0.4 mm high, lobed, sepals connate in basal 1/2, petals valvate in bud, apparently free at anthesis, nerveless or obscurely nerved, stamens with anthers 0.6 mm long, ± reniform, pistillode 0.4 mm high, stout, anvil-shaped.
Shrub, Subshrub, Solitary palm.
Pistillate 2.2-2.5 mm long, suburceolate, calyx 0.5-0.6 x 2.5-2.8 mm, lobed, nerved, sepals connate and/or imbricate basally, petals obscurely nerved externally, prominently 15-nerved within, constricted toward base where connate in a tube 0.2-0.3 mm high, staminodes lacking, pistil 1.5-1.9 mm long, styles short, stigma lobes separated.
They are small palms, growing to 0.3-6 m tall with slender, cane-like stems, growing in the understory in rainforests , and often spreading by means of underground runners , forming clonal colonies.

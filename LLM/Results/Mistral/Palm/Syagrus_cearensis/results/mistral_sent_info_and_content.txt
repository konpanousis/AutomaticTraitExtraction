We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Syagrus cearensis.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Androgynous inflorescences interfoliar, 45-85 cm from the first basal primary branch to the apex, prophyll ca.
The unbranched stems are topped with a crown of dark green, slightly plumose leaves.
Leaf , root , fruit.
Leaves 10-15 in crown, leaf sheath together with petiole ca.
Seed conforming to the shape of the endocarp cavity, subbasally attached, endosperm homogeneous or ruminate, sometimes with a central cavity, embryo basal or subbasal opposite one of the endocarp pores.
It is very similar to the species Syagrus oleracea , but is distinguished by the fruit, which has yellow flesh while S. oleracea has predominantly green fruits even when mature, and also S. cearensis has habit of growth in clumps, rather than the upright growth of the other species.
Seed ellipsoid, about 1.8 x 1.2 cm, and with a substantial central cavity about 6 mm in diam. /Palmweb.
It usually grows from 4 - 10 metres tall.
Graceful undergrowth palms from eastern Brazil with distinctive slender discolorous leaflets and fruit in which the pericarp splits longitudinally when ripe, exposing the endocarp.
Extremely variable genus native to the Caribbean and South America, where it is particularly abundant in drier areas, leaflets are concolourous and the mesocarp does not split.
Fronds have short stiff leaves and currently looks nothing like a queen palm to which it is related.
On the right is a picture of green fruit on the right and near.mature fruit on the left,.ripening to the.yellow color.
Palms 48 70-76.
An average tree can carry as many as 15 leaves or more.
The leaves get a length of up to 12 feet and are plumose, or.multi-ranked.
Unarmed, solitary or clustering palm in clusters of usually 2-4 stems growing in one plane, to multistemmed clusters.
Thin, tall, smooth ringed trunk and plumose long arching leaves.
Has large seed for a Syagrus.
Seed laterally attached with broad lateral hilum, endosperm homogeneous or deeply ruminate , with or without a central hollow, embryo basal opposite an endocarp pore.
Each leaf can be quite heavy and the petiole bases are fibrous and thick.
Appearance of the fruit.
Rank: FLOWERING.
Pistillate flowers slightly smaller to very much larger than the staminate flowers, sepals 3, distinct, broadly imbricate, triangular to ovate, acute or obtuse, fleshy to coriaceous, sometimes tomentose or scaly, petals 3, distinct, slightly shorter to slightly longer the than the sepals, triangular or ovate, broadly imbricate at the base, with minute to moderately large and conspicuous valvate tips, staminodal ring membranous, low, ± 6-toothed, occasionally apparently absent, gynoecium columnar to conical or ovoid, trilocular, triovulate, glabrous or tomentose to scaly, the stigmas 3, reflexed, fleshy, ovules laterally attached to the central wall of the locules, ?
Fruit small to relatively large, 1-seeded, spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal, variously green, brown, yellow, or reddish, sometimes beaked, the perianth segments and staminodal ring persistent and sometimes enlarging as a cupule at the fruit base, epicarp smooth or longitudinally striate, glabrous or hairy, mesocarp fleshy or dry, with abundant longitudinal fibres, endocarp thick, woody, with 3 basal or subbasal pores, sometimes beaked, sometimes with 3 longitudinal ridges, rarely with 3 irregular vertical bands of minute pores, endocarp cavity irregular or more usually circular, rarely triangular in cross-section, with 3, conspicuous, vertical lines, very rarely with a curved lateral protrusion into the seed.
Unarmed, solitary or clustering palm in clusters of usually 2-4 stems growing in one plane, to multi-stemmed clusters.
Trunk to 4-10 m tall and 10-18 cm diam., internodes 9-16 cm long at the base and shortening to 2-7 cm long towards the apex, producing a rough trunk with slightly stepped nodes.
The fruit is about 4 cm in diameter.
Stem very short, subterranean to erect and tall, rarely stolon-like, sometimes swollen basally, distally obscured by leaf-base remains, becoming bare, sometimes striate, and marked with inconspicuous or raised or impressed, oblique or circular conspicuous leaf scars.
The leaves are about head high and fairly upright, there's no clear trunk, and the palm is maybe the diameter of my ankle at its base.
The.outer bract of the flower is quite woody when mature and has a very sharp point.on
Trunk to 4-10 m tall and 10-18 cm in diam., internodes 9-16 cm long at the base and shortening to 2-7 cm long towards the apex, producing a rough trunk with slightly stepped nodes.
Slender, solitary, unarmed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
This means with each leaf nearly a foot of trunk height resulted.
Fruit light orange when mature, color often obscured by a thin dark brown indument, about as long as wide, 3.5-4.0 cm long and 3-4 cm diam.
Pollen ellipsoidal, frequently elongate, usually with either slight or obvious asymmetry, aperture a distal sulcus, ectexine tectate, finely or coarsely perforate, perforate and micro-channelled, or perforate-rugulate, aperture margin may be slightly finer, infratectum columellate, longest axis 34-54 µm.
A thick, yellow, fibrous, mucilaginous pulp with a slightly sweet flavour.
Spacing: 8-10 ft. 10-12 ft.
Small to tall, solitary or clustered, rarely forking below ground , unarmed or armed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
Inflorescences solitary, interfoliar, rarely spicate, usually branching to 1 order, ?
Stem erect, short, rarely exceeding 3 m, at first obscured by leaf sheath remains, later bare, closely ringed with leaf scars.
The few photos I have seen of this palm show it to be a neat well behaved Syagrus usually with 2 - 5 trunks.
Spacing: 10-12 ft. 12-15 ft.
Each of its usually two to four slender, smooth, 4 to 10 m tall trunks sports a bushy crown of ascending, plumose leaves.
The fruits are an intense yellow when mature and fall to the.ground when ready for germination.
Rank: SEED.
The crown is full and rounded.
Examples of very tall Queen.Palms.
Coco catole is a medium sized, clustering palm , often with only 2 stems and occasionally with only one.
Germination adjacent-ligular or remote tubular, eophyll entire.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

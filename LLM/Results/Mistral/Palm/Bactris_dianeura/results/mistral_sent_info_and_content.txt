We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Bactris dianeura.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Stems can be as narrow as 0.3-0.5 centimetres in B.aubletiana or as broad as 25 centimetres in B. gasipaes.
Spines deep blackish-brown,.those on basal part of petiole paler.Zobeida
They have simple or pinnately compound leaves and yellow, orange, red or purple-black fruit.
Ripe fruit can be yellow, orange, red or purple-black and range from 0.5-4.5 centimetres long. : 5-11.
All species have spiny leaves, the spines are often clustered on the petiole or rachis.
Leaves 5-7, leaf spines scattered, black or brown and then darker at apex, terete or sometimes somewhat flattened, to 6.5 cm long, on sheath, lateral surfaces of petiole, and abaxial surface or rachis, sheath 17-45 or more cm long, sheath, petiole, and rachis whitish or brownish tomentose, spinulose, ocrea to 8 cm long, petiole 26-80 cm long, rachis 58-90 cm long, with few spines to ca.
Flowers grow in triplets along the inflorescence, each female flower is flanked by two male flowers, elsewhere along the inflorescence male flowers grow singly or in pairs.
Multiple shoots, 2.5 cm dm., spiny.
The leaves can be either pinnately compound or simple, in some species like B. hirta both types of leaves exist.
In some species the spines are only found on the tips of the leaflets. : 4-5  Most species grow in multi-stemmed clumps with stems about 2 metres tall and 3 centimetres in diameter, but they span a range of sizes from tall trees to shrubs with subterranean stems and are sometimes single-stemmed.
Petioles range from 5 centimetres to over 1.5 metres in length, while the rachis can be 3 centimetres to over 3 metres long. : 4-5  Inflorescences are borne singly emerging from the leaf axil.
Stems cespitose, forming small clumps of 2-8 stems, 2-5 m tall, 1-3 cm diam., spiny on internodes.
Stems generally bear spines on the internodes, in B. glaucescens and B. setulosa spines are also present on the nodes.
Most species are small trees about 2 m tall, but some are large trees while others are shrubs with subterranean stems.
Treelet, 4 m tall, forest understory.
Sparingly colonial palm, rare in dense primary forest.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Sommieria leucophylla.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

They resemble the Asterogyne palms but are most closely related to those members of Heterospathe with short stems and sparsely branched inlforescences.
The Sommieria leucophylla Becc. is a monoecious plant with solitary stem, up to about 3 m tall, with a diameter of 2-4 cm, on which are visible the rings, very close together, trace of the fallen leaves.
The corky-warty, dark brown epicarp take a pinkish-red colours at maturity and breaks away in age exposing the brown, warty mesocarp.
There are around 60 stamens with very short filaments, the elongated, basifixed anthers carry triangle shaped pollen with reticulate, tectate exine.
This Sommieria specieas has long, thin, unsplit leaves that end in a point and have a markedly glaucous, nearly white, underside.
Dainty single stemmed understory New Guinea palm that is hightly sought after by collectors as it is a beautiful and slow growing specimen.
The inflorescences come out between the leaves, initially erect, the are up to about 1,5 m long, and formed by a main axis from which depart the floriferous branches, pendulous, with the cream or pale brown flowers disposed in the typical triad , the flowers have the phenomenon of the proterandry.

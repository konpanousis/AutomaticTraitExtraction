The flowers are produced in inflorescences , they are dioecious , with male and female flowers on separate plants.
Definitie: A leaf having two or more distinct leaflets that are evident as such from early in development.
The fruit is an orange or red drupe 0.5-2 cm diameter.
Rank: GERMINATING.

Leaf , root , seed.
Rank: SEEDLING.
Inflorescences among or below the leaves, solitary or several per leaf axil, unbranched or branched to 1 order, sometimes forked, staminate often more branched than pistillate, peduncle short to elongate, prophyll tubular with tapering bifid tip, peduncular bracts 2-several, elongate, tubular, sheathing the peduncle, coriaceous or membranous, persistent, tips short, bifid, rachillae, long or short, slender or fleshy, sometimes ridged, lacking bracts at maturity, bearing closely appressed or rather widely spaced, spirally arranged staminate or pistillate flowers, rarely bearing curved acervuli of staminate flowers.
Look how white it is when old leaf bases fall off too.
Rank: FLOWERING.
Some features of floral anatomy, including vascularisation of the ovule by a strand from each ventral bundle and abundant raphides in styles and stigmas, are characteristic of other genera in Chamaedoreeae and Ceroxyleae.
Germination adjacent-ligular, eophyll bifid or pinnate.
Inflorescences: interfoliar, erect-spreading, Staminate 7 at a node, central one largest and opening first, peduncle to 80 cm long, bracts 5-7, prophyll 2.5 cm long, others widely separated at insertion, tubular, 2nd bract truncate, 7.5 cm long, 3rd 16.5 cm, obliquely split, 4th 22 cm, 5th 25 cm, 6th 27 cm long, 7th 24 cm, rachis 3.5-7.5 cm long, rachillae 9-16, 11-24 cm long, smooth, pendulous.
Generally rather small, often clustering, pinnate-leaved dioecious palms from the undergrowth of rain forest from Mexico southwards to South America, very diverse and with a wide range of habits including one climbing species, inflorescence and flower form equally varied.
Fruit small, globose or oblong, stigmatic remains basal, epicarp smooth, mesocarp fleshy, endocarp thin.
Staminate flowers symmetrical, sepals 3, entire, united basally or distinct, petals 3, distinct or variously connate, lobes valvate, stamens 6, filaments short, broad or awl-shaped, anthers dorsifixed, included, oblong or didymous, pistillode various, cylindric or expanded basally, sometimes trilobed.
The mottling runs from the base of the plant, up the stem, into the crownshaft and finishes in the petioles.
Leaves: 5, pinnate, sheath 30-55 cm long, green mottled with white, petiole 45-100 cm long, light green mottled with white, rachis 1.3-1.55 m long, green or mottled with white to nearly white below, pinnae 30-39 on each side of rachis, apical ones 19-22 x 0.8-1.5 cm, central ones 39-48 x 2.4-3.2 cm, basal ones 27.5-30 x 0.5-1.6 cm, linear-lanceolate, slightly falcate, acute to acuminate, regularly arranged, spreading in one plane, thin, a midrib and 2 nerves on each side of this Â± elevated above and prominent below.
Seed erect, globose, or ellipsoidal, hilum small, basal, branches of raphe obscure, endosperm cartilaginous, embryo basal to subapical.
The leaves are pinnate , with one to numerous leaflets.
Pistillate solitary at node, peduncle 66-70 em long, bracts 58, similar to those of the staminate, rachis 2.5-10 cm long, rachillae 6-16, 7-20 cm long, 4 mm diam., orange in fruit, erect to spreading.
Habit: solitary, erect, 1.5-4 m tall or more.
Stem usually slender, covered wholly or partially in fibrous leaf bases or smooth, green, prominently ringed with leaf scars.
Flowers: Staminate in loose spirals, 4 mm long, orange, intensely fragrant, calyx 1.5-2 mm high, deeply lobed, light green in bud, orangish with dark brown margin at anthesis, sepals connate basally, rounded apically, petals 3-4 x 2-2.4 mm, ovate, valvate, free, smooth externally, grooved internally, dark green in bud, orange at anthesis, stamens 2.6 mm long, shorter than pistillode, 1/2 as high as petals, filaments 2 mm long, anthers 1.2 mm long, briefly bifid apically and basally, lilac, pistillode 3.5 mm high, columnar, 3-lobed apically.
Definitie: An autotroph which is capable of transforming light into chemical energy.
Leaves bifid or variously pinnate, very rarely entire, reduplicate, sheath closed or becoming split, short or elongate, sometimes with a marcescent lobe opposite the petiole, petiole short to elongate, flattened adaxially, rounded abaxially, sometimes with a prominent pale green or yellow, abaxial stripe, rachis rounded, angled, or flattened adaxially, rounded abaxially, blade entire, bifid and pinnately ribbed, or regularly or irregularly pinnately divided, leaflets few or many, of 1 or several folds, narrow or broad, often oblique or sigmoid, acuminate, surfaces glabrous.
Fruits: 15-18 x 8 mm, ellipsoid, black, mesocarp 0.5 mm thick, pale with long flat fibers, seeds 15 x 5 mm, ellipsoid, subfalcate.
Flowers sessile or partly enclosed in a cavity in the fleshy rachilla, small or minute.
Small, sometimes moderate, erect or procumbent, rarely climbing, acaulescent or trunked, solitary or clustered, unarmed, pleonanthic, dioecious palms.
They are small palms, growing to 0.3-6 m tall with slender, cane-like stems, growing in the understory in rainforests , and often spreading by means of underground runners , forming clonal colonies.

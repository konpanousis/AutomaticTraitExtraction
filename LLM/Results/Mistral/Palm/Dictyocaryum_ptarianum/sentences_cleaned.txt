Solitary, or very rarely clustered, moderate to robust, unarmed, pleonanthic, monoecious tree palms.
Stem solitary or occasionally cespitose, cylindrical, 10-15 m tall, 14-20 cm in diam., smooth, stilt roots to 1.2 m long, to 4 cm diam., brown, with blunt spines.
The fruit develops from one carpel, yellow to orange to brown when ripe, containing one basally attached, spherical seed.
Solitary, occasionally caespitose.
All three plants have conical masses of stilt roots at the base which are armed with spines.
Imagem principal.
Seed spherical, basally attached, seed coat thick with a conspicuous network of raphe fibres, hilum rounded, endosperm homogeneous, embryo basal.
Stem erect, slightly or rarely markedly ventricose, conspicuously ringed with leaf scars, with stilt roots bearing short somewhat sharp or cylindrical, lateral roots.
Tree, Solitary palm.
Staminate flowers fleshy, sessile, ± symmetrical, sepals 3, distinct, imbricate, rounded, strongly gibbous basally, petals much longer than the sepals, 3, slightly connate at the base, ± lanceolate, valvate, stamens 6, filaments short, broad, fleshy, anthers elongate, basifixed, latrorse, pistillode short, broad, columnar, rounded or minutely trifid at the apex.
All have tall crownshafts and 4-6 large, plumose, pinnate leaves.

Pollen ellipsoidal, ± bi-symmetric, aperture a distal sulcus, ectexine intectate, coarsely granular to gemmate, granulae/gemmae often coalesced into larger irregular units, aperture margin similar, longest axis 24-30 µm.
Fruit developing from 1 carpel, globose or ellipsoidal, with basal carpel and stigmatic remains, epicarp smooth, usually yellow at maturity, dark brown when dry, mesocarp thick with outer layer of sclereids and inner layer of tannin and fibres, endocarp very thin, scarcely differentiated.
Compared to other palms, the inflorescences in this genus are unusually large, once-branched, and emerge below the leaf crown.
The leaves may be sparsely to densely tomentose on the rachis and petiole, the leaflets are regularly and widely spaced, up to 60 cm long, dark green on top and glaucous on the underside.
Usually robust solitary or clustered pinnate-leaved tree palms of the Andes and foothills, the stems with stilt roots, leaflets are rhomboid, praemorse and are usually longitudinally divided to give the whole leaf an ostrich-feather appearance, fruit has basal stigmatic remains and embryo.
Both male and female flowers are white to yellow, growing on the same plant, both with three sepals and three petals.
Pistillate flowers smaller than the staminate, sessile, sepals 3, distinct, rounded, imbricate, thick, petals ca.
Dictyocaryum is a monoecious genus of flowering plant in the palm family found in South America.
The trunks are conspicuously ringed by leaf scars, to 30 cm wide, and in D. lamarckianum reach over 20 m in height.
Inflorescence pendulous and horn-shaped in bud, pendulous at anthesis and to 1.4 m long, peduncle terete, curved, 25-35 cm long, ca.

Definitie: A leaf having two or more distinct leaflets that are evident as such from early in development.
Rank: GERMINATING.
It is a solitary, skinny trunked palm with short leaves and ovoid, curled leaflets.
Spacing: 12-15 in.
Beautiful red new leaf.
Staminate flowers symmetrical, ± rounded to bullet-shaped, sometimes very small, sepals imbricate, petals valvate, basally briefly connate, stamens 3 or 6 , 3 staminodes sometimes present, these either antesepalous or antepetalous, very rarely adnate to the pistillode, pistillode present or absent.
Ellipsoid fruits, about 1 cm long and of 0,7 cm of diameter, containing only one ellipsoid seed, 0,7 cm long and of 0,5 cm of diameter, ruminated in depth.
A slender, solitary palm, up to 10m tall, with arching, pale green leaves,.and cupped, clumped leaflets.
The crownshaft is similar as well and as the trunk is forming it's turning slightly yellowish.
A complex and highly variable genus of pinnate-leaved palms that has radiated spectacularly in Madagascar and Comores, with an outlier on Pemba off the coast of Tanzania, the genus includes towering forest giants, bottle palms, litter-trappers, stemless palms, some of the most slender of all palms, and even two climbing members, all have fruit with basal stigmatic remains.
Leaves sometimes in 3 ranks, neatly abscissing, leaving conspicuous leaf-scars, leaflets numerous, often curved, single-fold.
Solitary palm, to 10 m tall.
Very small to very large unarmed pleonanthic monoecious palms.
Species vey similar when adult to the Dypsis pinnatifrons , distinguishable with certainty only from the male flowers, that present 6 stamina, instead of 3, and for the fruits as the endosperm is ruminated and not homogeneous.
Rather broad leaflets with drooping apices.
Spacing: 24-36 in.
Rank: FLOWERING.
Leaf , root and floral.
Fruit usually ellipsoidal, drupaceous, generally rather small, with stigmatic remains at one side near the base, epicarp smooth, outer mesocarp thin, fleshy, inner mesocarp reticulate fibrous, endocarp very thin.
Female flowers eventually larger than the â, sepals 3, free, imbricate, petals 3, free, imbricate, pistil with stigmas 3, closely adpressed in bud, spreading at anthesis, and 1 locule with 1 ovule.
Solitary or clustered, moderate, unarmed, occasionally aerially branching, reduplicately pinnate, pleonanthic, monoecious palms, with or without well-defined crown-shafts.
Germination adjacent-ligular, seedling leaf bifid.
Paripinnate leaves, on a short petiole, slightly arcuate, up to 90 cm long, with oblong-ovate pinnules with long pointed apex, irregularly arranged on the rachis in groups of 2-6 and inserted at different angles, in the median part 12-34 cm long and 1,5-4,5 cm broad, of intense green colour.
The inflorescences, on a 10-30 cm long peduncle, generate between the leaves enclosed in the initial phase of growth in a deciduous reddish brown bract, 20-90 cm long with -3 orders of ramifications.
Seed basally attached, slightly grooved longitudinally, endosperm homogeneous, embryo lateral or sub-basal.
Very similar in appearance to D. pinnatifrons ,.but not normally so robust.
New leaves are often pink/red.
The flowers are unisexual and arranged in groups of three , of red colour when in bud, and have the phenomenon of the proterandry, the male flowers ripe before the female ones, thus avoiding the self-fecundation and favouring the crossed one.
Definitie: An autotroph which is capable of transforming light into chemical energy.
This is one of the commonest and most widespread of all Madagascar palms, occurring from sea level up to nearly 1500 m. It is a very attractive single-stemmed species with a slender trunk and leaves with strongly grouped leaflets.
Fruit borne with persistent calyx and corolla,spherical, ellipsoid, fusiform or rarely curved, stigmatic remains basal,often obscured by perianth, epicarp often brightly coloured or jet blackor rarely dull green or brown, mesocarp thin, fleshy or fibrous, endocarpusually thin, fibrous.
Leaves. pinnate with two or more leaflets.
The Dypsis nodifera Mart. is an unarmed monoecious species with single stem, 2-10 m tall, with a diameter of up to 6 cm at the base, thinned towards the apex, of green colour in the youngest part, greyish in the oldest one, on which are visible the rings trace of the junction of the fallen leaves.
Male flowers symmetrical, sepals 3, free, imbricate, petals 3, free, valvate, stamens 6, anthers ± versatile, pistillode conical to columnar.
Pistillate flowers about the same size as the staminate, sepalsrounded, broadly imbricate, petals imbricate with triangular valvate tips,staminodes usually present, minute, tooth-like, usually 3 or 6 at one sideof the ovary, pistil pseudomonomerous, often strongly asymmetrical, stigmas 3, apical, sometimes eccentric,ovule form unknown.
Stems solitary or clustered, very short, subterranean, creeping-rhizomatous, erect, in one species climbing, sometimes branched aerially by apparent dichotomy.
Very skinny plant, often confused with the thinner-leaved versions of Dypsis pinnatifrons.
Native to Madagascar, Dypsis nodifera reaches the 10 m with 6 cm stems.
The leaf base wholly wraps the stem for a height of 15-30 cm forming a sort of a tubular capital of green grey colour with microscopic purple red scales, thicker in the terminal part.

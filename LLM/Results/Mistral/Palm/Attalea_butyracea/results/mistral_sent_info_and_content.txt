We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Attalea butyracea.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

It reproduces by seed, cleaned from the residuals of the fruit, placed at the depth of about 5 cm, at a temperature of 26-28 °C, the germination takes place in 4-6 months.
Male flowers pale yellow, with club shaped petals 10-20 mm long, and 6 stamens of the same length as the petals.
Species range from large trees with stout stems up to 30 metres tall to acaulescent palms.
The peduncle is the main stalk, connecting the rachis with the stem.
The inflorescence consists of a main axis-the peduncle and the rachis -and a series of smaller branches, the rachillae.
Attalea is a genus of non-spiny palms with pinnately compound leaves-rows of leaflets emerge on either side of the axis of the leaf in a feather-like or fern-like pattern.

Inflorescences between the leaves enclosed initially in a persistent woody spathe long up to about 2 m, erect, hanging in fruit, ramified, up to 1,3 m long, carrying either only male flowers, or with female flowers at the base and male ones at the apex.
Flowers are white to yellowish.
As you can see it's just now going pinnate, and the leaves are about 23" long and 7" wide.

Flowers: Monoicous Inflorescences many-branched racemes borne among the leaves with large persisting spathes, fist 2-4 all-male inflorescences are produced followed by a female, and then the pattern is repeated.
It has a straight, single stem that can grow up to 50 cm in diameter.
The fruit is 8cm or longer and 6cm wide, borne in very large racemes.
The seeds are more orange in color than yellow, and the seeds turn a dark brown when they fall and dry.
Fruits 1-4 per branch, light brown to orange at maturity, 5-12 cm long, with 1-3 seeds.

Cuban Petticoat Palm Tree: Small.
A very large solitary palm with big 'shuttlecock' leaves in which.all the leaflets are arranged in one plane.
The fruits are ovoid or ellipsoid with pointed apex, of 5-10 cm of length and 3-4,5 cm of diameter, of yellow colour, orange or brown when ripe, containing 1-3 whitish seeds, 3-5 cm long and 0,6-1,4 cm of diameter, containing 50-60% of oil.
Crown: with 15 to 40 leaves.
Pinnate leaves, up to 9 m long with foliar base provided at the margins of robust rigid fibres, short or absent petiole, linear pinnules, up to 1,5 m long in the central part and about 6 cm broad, of bright green colour on the upper page, pale green below, regularly distributed along the rachis on a same level and vertically placed in the second half of the leaf.
The seeds are probably 3 inches long.
They probably stay solid leaves for a while longer, maybe starting to go bifid/pinnate with leaves about 3x that size.
Boer is a monoecious species with single stem, tall up to about 20 m with a diameter of 20-40 cm, of brown grey colour covered in the younger part by the base of the old leaves.

Female flowers 5-25 per branch, ca.
This pinnately leaved, non-spiny genus includes both small palms lacking an aboveground stem and large trees.
Leaves arching, with twisted leaf axis so that the distal part of the blade stands in a vertical plane, pinnae to 200 on each side, regularly inserted in one plane, the central ones 120-160 cm long and 6-7 cm wide, with prominent, wavy cross veins.
The sap collects in the hollow where the bud was.
This large palm from Mexico and Central America grows to 60' tall and has a trunk that is the thickest in the genus, according to Encyclopedia of Cultivated Palms.
Inflorescences either consist entirely of male flowers, or are predominantly female with a few male flowers.
Fruit usually have two or three seeds, although fewer or more are present in some species, and are usually brown, yellow, orange-brown or purple when mature.
The seed takes 2 - 3 months to germinate.
Male flowers of pale cream colour with three sepals, three petals, about 1,5 cm long and 6 stamina, female flowers dark cream coloured about 2 cm long, the flowers emit a penetrating odour.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

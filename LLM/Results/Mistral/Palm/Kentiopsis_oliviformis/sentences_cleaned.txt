They seldom reach the horizontal, which gives the crown a somewhat, or definite, shaving brush aspect in older plants.
Pollen ellipsoidal or oblate triangular, slight or obvious asymmetry, aperture a distal sulcus or trichotomosulcus, ectexine tectate, perforate or perforate-rugulate, aperture margin similar or slightly finer, infratectum columellate, longest axis ranging from 39-52 µm.
Paul, the "Blue" in Kentiopsis is in the C/shaft far more so than in its leaves esp if they are in full sun as Jasons pic shows.

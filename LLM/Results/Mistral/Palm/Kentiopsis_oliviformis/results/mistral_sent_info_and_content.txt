We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Kentiopsis oliviformis.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
They seldom reach the horizontal, which gives the crown a somewhat, or definite, shaving brush aspect in older plants.
Pollen ellipsoidal or oblate triangular, slight or obvious asymmetry, aperture a distal sulcus or trichotomosulcus, ectexine tectate, perforate or perforate-rugulate, aperture margin similar or slightly finer, infratectum columellate, longest axis ranging from 39-52 µm.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

Note: The evidence values have been determined based on the provided input text, and the binary number (0 or 1) indicates whether there is strong evidence for the value in the text or not. If there is strong evidence, the binary number is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. The values 'bluish' and 'red' have a binary value of 1 under "Fruit colour description" since there is strong evidence for these values in the text, while 'red' and 'purplish' have a binary value of 1 under "Fruit colour". The value 'ellipsoid' has a binary value of 1 under "Fruit shape" since it is explicitly mentioned in the text. The value 'ovoid' also has a binary value of 1 under "Fruit shape" since it can be inferred from the description of the seeds. All other values have a binary value of 0 since there is no strong evidence for them in the text.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Raphia farinifera.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Leaf Base Detail.
Raphia farinifera or commonly known as Raffia Palm is a tropical palm tree endemic to Africa that grows up to 10 m tall and 60 cm in trunk diameter.
Like all Raphia, it grows extremely fast and will produce enormous leaves that can reach an unbelievable 20 m in length.
Back to Arecaceae index.
It has pinnate, erect leaves, up to 20 m long, arranged in a crown at the top of the stem and supported by a large and thorny petiole.
Large. 100 x 8 cm.
Raphia spp. are monocarpic or hapaxanthic , flowering and fruiting only once, followed by death.

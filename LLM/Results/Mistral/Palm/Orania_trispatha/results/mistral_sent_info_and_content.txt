We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Orania trispatha.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:

From this point both the radicle and first seedling leaf emerge.
Leaves 10 - 12 in the crown, distichously arranged, c. 3.01 - 5 m long, in some individuals also with appearance of brown coloured resin in every section, leaf-sheath massive, c. 20.5 - 60
This species develops a tall, stout, solitary trunk and its large leaves are distichuosly arranged, forming a giant fan.
Trunk about 15 - 22 m tall, about 20 - 30 cm in diam.
Abaxial praemorse juvenile leaflet apices and striking thin white coating.

Trunk c. 15 - 22 m tall, c. 20 - 30 cm diam. , much swollen at base, trunk very hard, bark light brown, internodes 12 cm, scars 5 cm, brighter coloured.
It has very brown-rusty petiole and branches that makes it so attractive.
It is indeed aptly named because it has a slender trunk topped by gently arching distichous fronds with waxy grey petioles often also coloured reddish-brown.
A very large, and spectacular palm, to about 20m, whose most notable feature.is its disticious leaf arrangement.
Eophyll bifid or pinnate.

Embryo placed below middle line of seed.
Abaxial juvenile leaf with striking thin white coating.
Trunk c. 15 - 22 m tall, c. 20 - 30 cm diam. , much swollen at base, trunk very hard, bark light brown, internodes 12 cm, scars 5 cm, brighter coloured.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

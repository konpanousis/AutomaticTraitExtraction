We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Livistona drudei.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Red Cabbage Palm Search eBay Wikipedia Species of palm Livistona mariae Conservation status Conservation Dependent  Scientific classification Kingdom: Plantae Clade: Tracheophytes Clade:
Usually tall, single-stemmed fan-palms of the Horn of Africa and Arabia, and Himalayas to Australia, there are a few dwarf species, most are hermaphroditic but a few dioecious species are known.
The leaves of this one wrap completely around the petiole, and splits in two about half way down the leaf.
Stem erect, obscured at first by persistent sheaths, later becoming bare or covered with persistent petiole bases, conspicuously or obscurely ringed with leaf scars.
A tall Livistona, to about 20m, with very finely divided leaflets.
It is a tall palm, growing up to about 20 m in height, with very finely divided leaflets that hang in -ribbons- on adult plants.
Fruit globose to pyriform, 10-12 mm long, 10-11 mm diam., semi-glossy purple-black, epicarp with scattered lenticellular pores, suture line extends for ca ½ length of fruit, marked with lip-like structures, mesocarp thin, fibrous, endocarp thin, brittle, pedicel 1-2 mm long.
Livistona drudei is a tall canopy palm to 28 m tall, leaves are large and regularly segmented, segment apices are pendulous, and with a bifurcate cleft to 60% of the segment length, the petiole bases are distinctively purple, the inflorescence is unbranched, not extending beyond the limit of the crown, and with up to 8 partial inflorescences, bracts are tightly tubular, flowers are cream to yellow, fruit are globose to pyriform, to 12 mm long by 11 mm wide, and semi-glossy purple black at maturity.
Eophyll 5-ribbed.
Spacing: 8-10 ft. 10-12 ft.
Petioles are armed and while this tree is smaller than L1, the thorns are larger.
Slender to robust, solitary, armed or unarmed, pleonanthic, hermaphroditic , shrub or tree palms.
Rank: SEED.
Germination remote-tubular, eophyll lanceolate, plicate, minutely toothed apically.
Leaves palmate or costapalmate, petiole unarmed or armed with spines, blade divided to varying depths into single-fold induplicate segments, filaments sometimes present at the sinuses.
Ovary of 3 free carpels that are united above to form a single slender style with apical stigma, ovule basal.
Fruit globose to pyriform, 10-12 mm long, 10-11 mm in diam., semi-glossy purple-black, epicarp with scattered lenticellular pores, suture line extends for about ½ length of fruit, marked with lip-like structures, mesocarp thin, fibrous, endocarp thin, brittle, pedicel 1-2 mm long.
It has leaves that don't quite go all the way around the petiole, and each leaf splits in two about half way down the leaf.
The trunk gets very smooth, as it does not retain thatch, but the very end of the leaf base does not detach, and leaves an interesting pattern on the trunk.
Very sharply armed petioles- careful when pruning.
Fruit usually developing from 1 carpel, stigmatic remains apical, epicarp smooth, mesocarp thin or thick, usually easily separated from the stony endocarp.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

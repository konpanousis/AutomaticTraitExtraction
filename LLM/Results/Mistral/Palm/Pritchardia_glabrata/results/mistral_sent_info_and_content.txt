We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Pritchardia glabrata.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

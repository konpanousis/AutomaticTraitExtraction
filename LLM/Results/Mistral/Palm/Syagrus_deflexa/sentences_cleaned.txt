The inflorescences are unbranched or branch once, a single hybrid, S.
Palms in this genus usually have solitary stems, clustered stems are less common, and a few are stolon -like subterranean.
The leaves of all but one species, S. smithii , are pinnately compound.
Leaf , root , fruit.
Seed conforming to the shape of the endocarp cavity, subbasally attached, endosperm homogeneous or ruminate, sometimes with a central cavity, embryo basal or subbasal opposite one of the endocarp pores.
The fruit are edible, ovate-lanceolate, yellow-orange, 2.5-3.5 x 1.6-2.5 cm, with a reddish apex.
Palm caespitose, rarely solitary, stems generally.arched, ringed but often covered with leaf base.remains, 2-3 m in height and 6-10 cm in diam.
It is identifiable by its feather palm pinnate leaves that arch inwards towards a thick stout trunk.
It grows to 4-10m tall, with 8-20 leaves to 2m long.
Description Palms in this genus usually have solitary stems, clustered stems are less common, and a few are stolon -like subterranean.
It is a small, fine leaf Palm, with many slender, up to 3 m tall stems, each carrying a bright crown of pinnate leaves.
It is the tallest of all the species in the genus Butia.
Graceful undergrowth palms from eastern Brazil with distinctive slender discolorous leaflets and fruit in which the pericarp splits longitudinally when ripe, exposing the endocarp.
Extremely variable genus native to the Caribbean and South America, where it is particularly abundant in drier areas, leaflets are concolourous and the mesocarp does not split.
They are monoecious , with both male and female flowers borne in the same inflorescence.
It is very similar to B. odorata , but is easily distinguished from this species by the distinct spathes which are densely covered in rust-coloured, woolly hairs.
They have simple or pinnately compound leaves and yellow, orange, red or purple-black fruit.
The name is derived from the fact that all of the leaflets are bent downwards, deflexed.
The stems are normally spineless, but some species have spiny leaf sheaths or spines.
The transition from the leaf sheath to the petiole can be gradual and difficult to identify, but in species where they can be distinguished, leaf sheaths are 2.5-180 cm long and the petioles are 0-30 cm.
Seed laterally attached with broad lateral hilum, endosperm homogeneous or deeply ruminate , with or without a central hollow, embryo basal opposite an endocarp pore.
The fruit are drupes, which vary in colour from green to orange to brown.
In rare cases, this palm can grow to 10 feet , with a trunk diameter of about 3 + 1 ⁄ 2 inches.
They range in size from 1.2 to 1.9   cm in length, and 0.7 to 4.5   cm in diameter.
Geonoma is a genus of small to medium-sized palms native to the forest understorey of tropical Central and South America.
Butia stolonifera was an oddly growing palm assigned to the genus Butia found only once in Uruguay in the 19th century, but which now is considered to be uncertain as a valid species.
Pistillate flowers slightly smaller to very much larger than the staminate flowers, sepals 3, distinct, broadly imbricate, triangular to ovate, acute or obtuse, fleshy to coriaceous, sometimes tomentose or scaly, petals 3, distinct, slightly shorter to slightly longer the than the sepals, triangular or ovate, broadly imbricate at the base, with minute to moderately large and conspicuous valvate tips, staminodal ring membranous, low, ± 6-toothed, occasionally apparently absent, gynoecium columnar to conical or ovoid, trilocular, triovulate, glabrous or tomentose to scaly, the stigmas 3, reflexed, fleshy, ovules laterally attached to the central wall of the locules, ?
x lacerdamourae , occasionally shows second-order branching, and emerge from between the leaves.
Fruit small to relatively large, 1-seeded, spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal, variously green, brown, yellow, or reddish, sometimes beaked, the perianth segments and staminodal ring persistent and sometimes enlarging as a cupule at the fruit base, epicarp smooth or longitudinally striate, glabrous or hairy, mesocarp fleshy or dry, with abundant longitudinal fibres, endocarp thick, woody, with 3 basal or subbasal pores, sometimes beaked, sometimes with 3 longitudinal ridges, rarely with 3 irregular vertical bands of minute pores, endocarp cavity irregular or more usually circular, rarely triangular in cross-section, with 3, conspicuous, vertical lines, very rarely with a curved lateral protrusion into the seed.
The palm has a small stature, only growing to a height of 6 feet.
Stem very short, subterranean to erect and tall, rarely stolon-like, sometimes swollen basally, distally obscured by leaf-base remains, becoming bare, sometimes striate, and marked with inconspicuous or raised or impressed, oblique or circular conspicuous leaf scars.
Those species that have upright trunks grow 2–36 metres tall with stems that are 6–35 centimetres in diameter.
The transition from the leaf sheath to the petiole can be gradual and difficult to identify, but in species where they can be distinguished, leaf sheaths are 2.5–180   cm long and the petioles are 0–30   cm.
Slender, solitary, unarmed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
Those species that have upright trunks grow 2-36 metres tall with stems that are 6-35 centimetres in diameter.
It is caespitose, branching underground with normally 3-6 branches.
The leaves are bent at the end, with very hairy margins near the trunk, and consist of 180-320 slightly coiled leaflets irregularly arranged in several planes on the rake.
The leaflets are dark green leaf upper and a silvery leaf underside.
Pollen ellipsoidal, frequently elongate, usually with either slight or obvious asymmetry, aperture a distal sulcus, ectexine tectate, finely or coarsely perforate, perforate and micro-channelled, or perforate-rugulate, aperture margin may be slightly finer, infratectum columellate, longest axis 34-54 µm.
Most species are small trees about 2 m tall, but some are large trees while others are shrubs with subterranean stems.
Small to tall, solitary or clustered, rarely forking below ground , unarmed or armed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
Inflorescences solitary, interfoliar, rarely spicate, usually branching to 1 order, ?
Stem erect, short, rarely exceeding 3 m, at first obscured by leaf sheath remains, later bare, closely ringed with leaf scars.
They range in size from 1.2 to 1.9 cm in length, and 0.7 to 4.5 cm in diameter.
The fruit are oval, greenish-yellow, 6–9 cm long.
It grows to 60–160 cm tall, with 5-12 leaves with 24-40 leaflets a side.
Germination adjacent-ligular or remote tubular, eophyll entire.
This slow-growing palm grows up to 10m, although it is often less tall.

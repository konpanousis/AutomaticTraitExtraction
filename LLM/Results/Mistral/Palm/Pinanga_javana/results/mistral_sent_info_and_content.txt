We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Pinanga javana.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Seed ovoid to ellipsoid, 18-21 x 10-13 mm, deeply ruminate.
It has a long, golden crownshaft, a relatively sparse crown of leaves, and a thin green, ringed trunk.
On the other hand, P. coronata is a small and clustered palm, and the arrangement of its rachillae is always spiral.
Pistillate flower cream, ovary green, calyx cup-shaped, sepals 3, imbricate, broadly orbicular, 6-8 x 4-4.5 mm, smooth, thick at the middle, thin at side, with ciliate margins, apex mucronate, corolla with 3 cucullate rounded ciliate petals, 4-6 x 3-4 mm, apex mucronate-obtuse.
Leaves 10 in crown, pinnate, whole leaf 250-300 cm with silvery indumentum on petiole and rachis, very massive, leaf-sheath to 100 cm, petiole to 30 cm, concave adaxially, convex abaxially, rachis 3 cm diam., leaflets 10-15 on each side of rachis, regularly arranged, slightly arcuate, elongate linear-lanceolate, falcate-sigmoid, equidistant, basal leaflets 65-95 x 1-6 cm, ribs 1-3, middle leaflets 70-115 x 2.7 cm, ribs 1-3, apical leaflets 19-55 x 1.5-7.5 cm, ribs 2-7.
It's about 8' overall, with about a foot or so of ringed trunk.
Stem erect, 4-10 m tall, 10-15 cm diam., internodes to 10-30 cm, stem surface green brownish, smooth, slightly fissured longitudinally.
.Opening the first leaf of spring.
Rank: SEEDLING.
Inflorescence infrafoliar, hand-like, spreading pendulous, 40-50 cm long, peduncle erect at base, flattened, 9-16 cm long, 0.8-1.5 cm thick, prophyll not known, rachillae 8-13, arranged distichously alternate, at the base 23-35 cm with 19-21 triads, at the apex 18-27 cm with 15-17 triads, peduncle, rachis, and rachillae green when young, pinkish red with age.
This is a two year old, in the ground plant about 18" tall.
Quite a large species, it forms a solitary, tall trunk, topped by a silky green crownshaft that holds several gracefully arching, pinnate leaves with wide leaflets.
It is a robust palm, always solitary, and the arrangement of the rachillae is always alternate and distichous.
Crownshaft elongate, 150-200 cm long, 25 cm diam., swollen, purplish brown, with brown scales.
Fruit ovoid to ellipsoid, 20-26 x 11-14 mm, pale pinkish yellow when young, when ripe turning dark red then black, pericarp densely fibrous, endocarp thin, membranous.
Rank: FLOWERING.
Leaves 10 in the crown, pinnate, whole leaf 250-300 cm with silvery indumentum on petiole and rachis, very massive, leaf-sheath to 100 cm, petiole to 30 cm, concave adaxially, convex abaxially, rachis 3 cm in diam., leaflets 10-15 on each side of rachis, regularly arranged, slightly arcuate, elongate linear-lanceolate, falcate-sigmoid, equidistant, basal leaflets 65-95 x 1-6 cm, ribs 1-3, middle leaflets 70-115 x 2.7 cm, ribs 1-3, apical leaflets 19-55 x 1.5-7.5 cm, ribs 2-7.
Crownshaft elongate, 150-200 cm long, 25 cm in diam., swollen, purplish brown, with brown scales.
Spacing: 4-6 ft. 6-8 ft. 8-10 ft.
.The shoe is 12.5-¬ù 32 cm long.
Stem erect, 4-10 m tall, 10-15 cm in diam., internodes to 10-30 cm, stem surface green brownish, smooth, slightly fissured longitudinally.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

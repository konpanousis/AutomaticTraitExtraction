Phytelephas macrocarpa is a single-stemmed, unarmed, reclining or erect palm from the extreme northern coastal regions of South America , growing to some 12 m tall.
When ripe, they yield globose.clusters of partially connate fruits , bearing 6-9 seeds.
Open / Close.
When ripe, the fruit which has formed on the female tree, breaks apart and the woody epicarp covered in spines disintegrates, allowing the nuts to fall to the ground.
Fruits forming heads up to 40 cm.
The inflorescences generate between the leaves, the male ones are formed by a cylindrical spadix, fleshy, about 70 cm long, bearing white flowers, sessile , about 1,6 cm long, united in groups of four, with 25-250 stamens per group, the female inflorescences generate at the level of the soil, are globose, compact, with about 22 cm long grouped flowers, the flowers, either male or female, emit a pungent odour.
Solitary rosette palm, with prostrate subterranean part of stem and aerial part wanting, or mid-sized palm tree with decumbent, or erect stem up to 4 m tall.
Shrub, Solitary palm.
It is arched and ascending up to a short distal end where a thick.crown of erect, pinnate leaves, up to 6 m long, arises.
The trunk is about 30 cm across, with prominent leaf scars.
Dioecious palm, usually solitary, short, sometimes creeping in a semi-subterranean fashion, trunk about 2 m. high and 30 cm.
Flowers form among the leaves, and in bud are enclosed in two sheaths.
Si riproduce per seme, in substrati sabbiosi, che germina in 3-6 mesi nelle migliori condizioni, ma può impiegare anche alcuni anni.

The outer husk is thick and woody with numerous sharp spines, the mesocarp is thin, fleshy, oily and yellowish-orange in colour.
Each fruit houses 5 or 6 seeds of about 5 x 3 cm, these normally being wedge-shaped, though quite variable in both size and shape, the endosperm is homogeneous, and liquid at first, becoming gelatinous later and finally extremely hard, white and ivory-like, occasionally with a small central cavity.

They are climber s. Individuals can grow to 19 m.
Leaflets eventually grow up to 2' long and 3" wide- very large.
Fruit 1-seeded, ± ovoid or spherical, bright red, deep purple, or black, with apical stigmatic remains, epicarp smooth, mesocarp thin, fleshy, endocarp stony with 3 pores slightly distal to the equator.
Most species are small trees about 2 metres tall, but some are large trees while others are shrubs with subterranean stems.
Definitie: whole plant growth form.
Stem covered with leaf sheaths, eventually becoming bare, with long internodes and conspicuous nodal scars, the first stem slender, not usually reaching a great height before being replaced by more robust sucker shoots.
They have simple or pinnately compound leaves and yellow, orange, red or purple-black fruit.
Chelyocarpus is a genus of small to medium-sized fan palms which are native to northwestern South America.
Inflorescence 40-50 cm long, branches numerous, to 10 cm long or more.
Very spiny palm and even has hooks on the end of each leaf.
Plants 22.3 m tall, stems 4.4 cm diameter, solitary.
Plants flower repeatedly over the course of their lifespan and have separate male and female flowers, although these are borne together on the same inflorescence.
Desmoncus polyacanthos , the jacitara palm , is a spiny, climbing palm native to the southern Caribbean and tropical South America.
Slender, clustering , spiny, pleonanthic, monoecious climbing palms.
Definition: whole plant herbaceous.
Desmoncus leaves are pinnately compound and are made up of a leaf sheath , petioles , rachis , and individual leaflets.
Most have pinnately compound leaves , one species has entire leaves.
Stem solitary, to 30 m long and 5 cm in diameter, usually covered with persistent leaf sheaths.
Clustering spiny climbing palms of Central and South America, with reflexed acanthophylls borne on a whip at the end of the leaf.
There are about 26 species in the genus, ranging in size from understorey shrubs with subterranean stems to subcanopy trees as tall as 20 metres.
Mauritiella is a dioecious genus of flowering plant in the palm family found in South America where it is commonly called buriti.
Germination adjacent-ligular, eophyll bifid with rather broad, acute segments or pinnate.
Leaves tend to remain green on 'trunk' for the entire top 1/3 of the palm.
Definitie: An autotroph which is capable of transforming light into chemical energy.
Stems grow clustered together, and are 2–12 m long and 0.5–2 cm in diameter.
Petioles, rachis, cirrus and peduncular bracts are covered with short, curved spines.
Stems, leaves and sometimes even the fruit are covered with spines.
Bactris campestris is a small spiny palm which grows in multi-stemmed clumps in savannas and low forests in northern South America from Colombia to the Guianas, Trinidad and Tobago, and northern Brazil.
Seed ovoid, with 3 surface hollows, basally attached, hilum basal, circular, raphe branches densely anastomosing, endosperm homogeneous, embryo lateral.
The ends of the leaves are modified into a climbing structure called a cirrus.
Fruits red, elongate, ca.
Spacing: 15-20 ft. 20-30 ft. 30-40 ft.
Leaflets ovoid and have a wavy appearance.

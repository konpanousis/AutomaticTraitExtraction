Many Dypsis species have aerial branching , a rare growth habit among palms.
Many Dypsis species aerial branching, rare growth habit among palms.
Staminate flowers symmetrical, ± rounded to bullet-shaped, sometimes very small, sepals imbricate, petals valvate, basally briefly connate, stamens 3 or 6 , 3 staminodes sometimes present, these either antesepalous or antepetalous, very rarely adnate to the pistillode, pistillode present or absent.
A complex and highly variable genus of pinnate-leaved palms that has radiated spectacularly in Madagascar and Comores, with an outlier on Pemba off the coast of Tanzania, the genus includes towering forest giants, bottle palms, litter-trappers, stemless palms, some of the most slender of all palms, and even two climbing members, all have fruit with basal stigmatic remains.
Leaves sometimes in 3 ranks, neatly abscissing, leaving conspicuous leaf-scars, leaflets numerous, often curved, single-fold.
Very small to very large unarmed pleonanthic monoecious palms.
Leaf , root and floral.
Fruit usually ellipsoidal, drupaceous, generally rather small, with stigmatic remains at one side near the base, epicarp smooth, outer mesocarp thin, fleshy, inner mesocarp reticulate fibrous, endocarp very thin.
Female flowers eventually larger than the â, sepals 3, free, imbricate, petals 3, free, imbricate, pistil with stigmas 3, closely adpressed in bud, spreading at anthesis, and 1 locule with 1 ovule.
They are slender, evergreen palms yellow flowers carried in panicles amongst pinnate leaves.
Solitary or clustered, moderate, unarmed, occasionally aerially branching, reduplicately pinnate, pleonanthic, monoecious palms, with or without well-defined crown-shafts.
Germination adjacent-ligular, seedling leaf bifid.
It is clustering with overhanging stems, petiole 0.5-1 cm, leaflets 23-26 on each side of the rachis, almost regular, the median 13-16 x 0.9-1 cm, rachillae 10-13 cm.
Seed basally attached, slightly grooved longitudinally, endosperm homogeneous, embryo lateral or sub-basal.
Its thin stems can reach a height of up to 7 m , the leaves hold narrow leaflets arranged in small groups.
They are slender, evergreen palms with yellow flowers carried in panicles amongst the pinnate leaves.
Fruit borne with persistent calyx and corolla,spherical, ellipsoid, fusiform or rarely curved, stigmatic remains basal,often obscured by perianth, epicarp often brightly coloured or jet blackor rarely dull green or brown, mesocarp thin, fleshy or fibrous, endocarpusually thin, fibrous.
They are easily recognizable as juveniles their reddish purple leaves and stems, which become glaucous green and white respectively as the plant matures.
Male flowers symmetrical, sepals 3, free, imbricate, petals 3, free, valvate, stamens 6, anthers ± versatile, pistillode conical to columnar.
Pistillate flowers about the same size as the staminate, sepalsrounded, broadly imbricate, petals imbricate with triangular valvate tips,staminodes usually present, minute, tooth-like, usually 3 or 6 at one sideof the ovary, pistil pseudomonomerous, often strongly asymmetrical, stigmas 3, apical, sometimes eccentric,ovule form unknown.
Stems solitary or clustered, very short, subterranean, creeping-rhizomatous, erect, in one species climbing, sometimes branched aerially by apparent dichotomy.

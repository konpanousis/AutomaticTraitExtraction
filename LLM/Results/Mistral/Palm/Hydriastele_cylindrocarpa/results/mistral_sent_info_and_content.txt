We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Hydriastele cylindrocarpa.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Pistillate flowers 2.5-4 mm high, 2.25 mm broad, staminodes 2-6.
The inflorescences are branched to three orders with both male and female flowers , some of which are beetle -pollinated.
The fruit may be ellipsoidal or spherical and colored yellow, orange, red, purple, or black when ripe, each with a single seed.
Gorgeous palm with pale yellow to silvery green crownshaft, 8' long strongly arched leaves with upright leaflets forming a V shape looking down the leaf and stilt roots as a younger palm.

Gorgeous palm, with pale yellow to silvery green crownshaft 8' long, strongly arched leaves, with upright leaflets forming a V shape looking down the leaf, and stilt roots as a younger palm.
Staminate flowers 2.5 mm long , stamens 6.
Fruit apparently yellowish at maturity, cylindrical to somewhat ovoid, slightly curved, l2-I3 X 5-6 mm, cupule about 3.5 mm high, seed with homogeneous endosperm.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.
Individuals can grow to 27 m.
It forms a tall, slender, solitary trunk to 27 m tall, that holds a large, glaucous crownshaft and a crown of elegantly and strongly arching, deeply keeled and finely pinnate leaves.
Definitie: An autotroph which is capable of transforming light into chemical energy.
Inflorescence branchine to 2 orders, the lowerp rimary branches divided into about 4 rachillae, with about 25-32 rachillae altogether, rachillae to 43 cm long, 2-2.5 mm wide, bearing up to about 190 traids.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

Note: The binary numbers (1 or 0) indicate whether there is strong evidence for the value in the input text (1 for yes, 0 for no or not sure). The "Fruit colour description" and "Fruit colour" traits have been updated based on the input text, while the other traits do not have strong evidence in the text and are set to 0.

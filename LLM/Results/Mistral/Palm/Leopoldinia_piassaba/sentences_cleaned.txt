Fruit dull red at maturity, ovoid, slightly flattened laterally, or strongly lenticular or disciform, 1-seeded, developing from 1 carpel, perianth whorls persisting, stigmatic and sterile carpellary remains basal, epicarp smooth, mesocarp composed of several complex reticulate systems of thick anastomosing fibres, embedded in fleshy parenchyma, the fibres becoming more numerous and closer towards the centre of the fruit, endocarp thin, smooth internally.
Leopoldinia piassaba is an evergreen Tree growing to 10 m by 8 m at a fast rate.
Stems erect, covered with marcescent leaf sheath fibres, eventually becoming bare, internodes short, at the base of the stem with abundant adventitious roots.
Piassaba, Leopoldinia piassaba, is a palm native to Brazil and Venezuela that grows about 4 or 5 m tall with a trunk diameter of 15 cm.
Developing from one carpel, the fruit matures to red in color, may be ellipsoidal, laterally flattened or disciform, and contains one seed.
Inflorescences dimorphic, prophylls no data, peduncular bracts no data, peduncles 56.0 cm long, 49.8 mm diameter, staminate rachillae 1.6 cm long, pistillate rachillae 14.1 cm long, fruits 41.0 mm long, 34.6 mm diameter, not flattened, globose to ellipsoid, the surfaces with raised, reticulate ridges from mesocarp fibers, giving a wrinkled appearance.
The 1 m leaflets are once-folded, linear, regularly arranged, and either acuminate or briefly bifid.
Leopoldinia is a mostly monoecious genus of flowering plant in the palm family from northern South America , where they are known as jarx¡ palm or pissava palm.
Leopoldinia is an evergreen Tree growing to 10 m by 8 m at a fast rate.
Plants -6.2 m tall, stems 5.8 m tall, 15.0 cm in diameter, solitary.
Tree, Solitary palm.
There may be male and female flowers on different inflorescences, they may alternate along the same branches, in some cases the female flowers are proximal while the male's are distal, some are hermaphroditic and others are simply, but rarely, dioecious.
Seed rounded or lenticular, attached opposite the stigmatic remains, with a vertical hilum running across one of the lateral faces, endosperm homogeneous, embryo subbasal.
Remarkable pinnate-leaved palms from Amazonia, the stems covered by long fibres or a broad network of fibres, the fruit lens-shaped or egg-like, with basal stigmatic remains.
The long, tough yet flexible, brown fibers are produced abundantly on the margins of the old, frayed leafstalks which hang down covering the trunk to the very base in a dense, beard-like mass.
Pistillate flowers larger than the staminate, sepals 3, distinct, imbricate, rounded, ± hooded, the margins ± toothed, petals 3, distinct, valvate, staminodes 6, distinct, very small, short, flat and ± truncate, gynoecium trilocular, triovulate, ± pyramidal, stigmas 3, rather obscure, sessile, ovule form unknown.
Inflorescences dimorphic, prophylls no data, peduncular bracts no data, peduncles 56.0 cm long, 49.8 mm in diameter, staminate rachillae 1.6 cm long, pistillate rachillae 14.1 cm long,.fruits 41.0 mm long, 34.6 mm in diameter, not flattened, globose to ellipsoid, the surfaces with raised, reticulate ridges from mesocarp fibers, giving a wrinkled appearance.

Leaves 18 per stem, sheaths 45 cm long, fibers from apices elongate, loose, pendulous, petioles 118.8 cm long, rachises 290.0 cm long, 18.4 mm diameter, pinnae 59 per side of rachis, spreading horizontally, the bases narrowed with abaxial, distal and proximal swellings adjacent to rachis, midveins prominent and raised in cross-section adaxially, basal pinna 41.0 cm long, 0.7 cm wide, forming an angle of 45° with the rachis, apical pinna 37.0 cm long, 0.9 cm wide, forming an angle of 6° with the rachis.

Germination adjacent-ligular, eophyll bifid, the segments very slender.
The fruits are kidney shaped and flattened.
Moderate, solitary or clustered, unarmed, pleonanthic, monoecious rarely dioecious according to Spruce palms.
Its crown is composed of 14 - 16 sword-shaped, yellow green leaves with each leaf measuring about 4-5 m long.
These fibres persist and hang, entirely concealing the stem, and giving the tree a most curious and unique appearance.
The pinnate leaves, up to 5 m, are carried on long, hairy petioles which disintegrate into black, fibrous masses against the trunk.
The much branched inflorescence is short, brown, and hairy and emerges within the leaf crown.
Growth Habit - N/A.
Pollen ellipsoidal, slightly asymmetric, aperture a distal sulcus, ectexine tectate, surface very finely granular, finely perforate, or perforate and slightly rugulate, aperture margin similar, infratectum columellate, longest axis 21-26 µm.
The fibres at first appear as light brown ribbon-like strips, 2 - I0cm wide, that later split into dark brown to greyish brown individual fibres.
The trunks are clustering in L. major , occasionally clustering in L. pulchra , and solitary in L. piassaba , they reach 15 cm wide to 6 m tall, and are usually covered in old, extremely fibrous leaf bases.
Leaves 18 per stem, sheaths 45 cm long, fibers from apices elongate, loose, pendulous, petioles 118.8 cm long, rachises 290.0 cm long, 18.4 mm diameter, pinnae 59 per side of rachis, spreading horizontally, the bases narrowed with abaxial, distal and proximal swellings adjacent to rachis, midveins prominent and raised in cross-section adaxially, basal pinna 41.0 cm long, 0.7 cm wide, forming an angle of 45° with the rachis, apical pinna 37.0 cm long, 0.9 cm wide, forming an angle of 6 ° with the rachis.
The adult leaves are cut in order to access the leaf sheaths.

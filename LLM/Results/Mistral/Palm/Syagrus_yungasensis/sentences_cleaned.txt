The inflorescences are unbranched or branch once, a single hybrid, S.
Palms in this genus usually have solitary stems, clustered stems are less common, and a few are stolon -like subterranean.
The leaves of all but one species, S. smithii , are pinnately compound.

Rank: GERMINATING.
Seed conforming to the shape of the endocarp cavity, subbasally attached, endosperm homogeneous or ruminate, sometimes with a central cavity, embryo basal or subbasal opposite one of the endocarp pores.
Last years strap leaf spotted a bit, but this years leaves look fine.
Pistillate flowers 9-10 mm, sepals and petals apiculate, ovary glabrous with trifid stigmas, staminodial ring to 2 mm high, undulate.
Graceful undergrowth palms from eastern Brazil with distinctive slender discolorous leaflets and fruit in which the pericarp splits longitudinally when ripe, exposing the endocarp.
Extremely variable genus native to the Caribbean and South America, where it is particularly abundant in drier areas, leaflets are concolourous and the mesocarp does not split.
They are monoecious , with both male and female flowers borne in the same inflorescence.
Rank: SEEDLING.
The stems are normally spineless, but some species have spiny leaf sheaths or spines.
Stem solitary 4-5 m tall, 7-9 cm diam., smooth surface with overlapping internodes without foliar bases.
A recently described, beautiful and very rare small Syagrus from the Yungas region of Bolivia that growns to only about 5 m tall.
The transition from the leaf sheath to the petiole can be gradual and difficult to identify, but in species where they can be distinguished, leaf sheaths are 2.5-180 cm long and the petioles are 0-30 cm.
Seed laterally attached with broad lateral hilum, endosperm homogeneous or deeply ruminate , with or without a central hollow, embryo basal opposite an endocarp pore.
The fruit are drupes, which vary in colour from green to orange to brown.
As an adult, it looks a lot like a Queen palm with long, arching fronds of plumose leaves.
Rank: FLOWERING.

Pistillate flowers slightly smaller to very much larger than the staminate flowers, sepals 3, distinct, broadly imbricate, triangular to ovate, acute or obtuse, fleshy to coriaceous, sometimes tomentose or scaly, petals 3, distinct, slightly shorter to slightly longer the than the sepals, triangular or ovate, broadly imbricate at the base, with minute to moderately large and conspicuous valvate tips, staminodal ring membranous, low, ± 6-toothed, occasionally apparently absent, gynoecium columnar to conical or ovoid, trilocular, triovulate, glabrous or tomentose to scaly, the stigmas 3, reflexed, fleshy, ovules laterally attached to the central wall of the locules, ?
x lacerdamourae , occasionally shows second-order branching, and emerge from between the leaves.
Stem very short, subterranean to erect and tall, rarely stolon-like, sometimes swollen basally, distally obscured by leaf-base remains, becoming bare, sometimes striate, and marked with inconspicuous or raised or impressed, oblique or circular conspicuous leaf scars.
Sometimes known as a dwarf Queen palm, tops out at a max height of about 15'.
Slender, solitary, unarmed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.

Those species that have upright trunks grow 2-36 metres tall with stems that are 6-35 centimetres in diameter.
Leaves 13-18, ca.
It has the one main trunk base with many small suckers beginning to show.
Pollen ellipsoidal, frequently elongate, usually with either slight or obvious asymmetry, aperture a distal sulcus, ectexine tectate, finely or coarsely perforate, perforate and micro-channelled, or perforate-rugulate, aperture margin may be slightly finer, infratectum columellate, longest axis 34-54 µm.
Small to tall, solitary or clustered, rarely forking below ground , unarmed or armed, pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
Inflorescences solitary, interfoliar, rarely spicate, usually branching to 1 order, ?
Stem erect, short, rarely exceeding 3 m, at first obscured by leaf sheath remains, later bare, closely ringed with leaf scars.
They range in size from 1.2 to 1.9 cm in length, and 0.7 to 4.5 cm in diameter.
Fruit 3.5- 4 X 2.5-3 cm, epicarp smooth, green with brown scales at apex, mesocarp fibrous, endocarp 5 mm thick covered with persistent coarse fibers, rough surface, beaked at the base and with lightly prominent ridges that stop short of apex, seed 1, endosperm homogenous.

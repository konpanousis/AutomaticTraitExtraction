We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Hydriastele longispatha.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

The fruit lack the series of fibrous bundles in the outer pericarp characteristic of Hydriastele Longispatha, but otherwise the pericarp structure is very similar.
A tall, finely solitary pinnate palm with recurved leaves.
The leaves are like cardboard and leaf veins are covered with waxy scales which eventually fall off.
Inflorescence branching to 2 orders, with 6-7 secondary axes, these white, glabrous, upper peduncular bract present, 20 cm long, narrow, triangular, rachillae 48 cm long with about 134 triads.
The trunks may be solitary or suckering and may be diminutive to robust, spanning a range of heights.
Individuals can grow to 24 m.
The leaf rachis is not as strongly arcuate as in H. longispatha and the pinnae are stiff and erect, not drooping at the tips as in that species.
The inflorescences are branched to three orders with both male and female flowers , some of which are beetle -pollinated.
The fruit may be ellipsoidal or spherical and colored yellow, orange, red, purple, or black when ripe, each with a single seed.
Staminate flowers white, 17 mm long and 4.5-6.5 mm wide, stamens 12, pistillode lacking, pistiliate flowers white, 3 mm high.
Solitary palm, with stems 15 20 cm in diameter, leaves about 22 per crown, strongly arcuate, with pinnae ascending and rigid, not drooping at the tips, sheath ll0 cm long, petiole 40 cm long, blade 210 cm long, petiole and rachis brown lepidote above and below, pinnae about 57 on each side, to 80 cm long, 2.2 cm wide, glabrous above, brown-dotted below, lacking ramenta.
The leaves are pinnate and widely varied.
The leaf rachis is not as strongly arcuate as in Hydriastele longispatha and the pinnae are stiff and erect, not drooping at the tips as in that species.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.
Rank: FLOWERING.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Chamaedorea allenii.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
The flowers are produced in inflorescences , they are dioecious , with male and female flowers on separate plants.
The stem varies from 1.5 -2 cm in diameter, and the plant exhibits both pinnate and bifid leaves that are not solely restricted according to the age of the plant as are some Chamaedoreas of this type.
The fruit is an orange or red drupe 0.5-2 cm diameter.
Pistillate in 8 dense spirals, contiguous in bud, 2.5 x 3.5 mm, depressed-globose, bright yellow, sunken in shallow pits but so densely packed as to appear to be immersed in axis, calyx prominent, 1.5 x 3.5 mm, shallowly undulate, whitish, sepals connate nearly to apex, forming a tight hyaline sheath around base of flower, ± straight apically, petals 2.5 x 2.5 mm, broadly triangular, cupped, imbricate nearly to apex, margins rounded, straight apically but with a small acute point, staminodes lacking, pistil 2 x 2 mm, conic, fleshy, whitish, stigma lobes sessile, spreading or erect, prominent, barely exceeding petals.
Pistillate with peduncle 20 cm long, 8 mm wide at base and ± flattened, 6-8 mm diam.
Pistillate flower with sepals 3, as in the staminate, petals 3, usually connate, distinct lobes valvate or imbricate, staminodes present and tooth-like or absent, gynoecium ovoid, tricarpellate, syncarpous, trilocular, trilovulate, stigmas small, recurved, ovule campylotropous, laterally inserted.
Fruits: 7-10 mm diam., densely packed, globose but angled from mutual pressure, black, epicarp rough, seeds 5-7 mm diam., globose but slightly angled, brown.
Solitary species slight ridged, lancelote leaves and bamboo-like stem.
Leaf , root , seed.
Inflorescences among or below the leaves, solitary or several per leaf axil, unbranched or branched to 1 order, sometimes forked, staminate often more branched than pistillate, peduncle short to elongate, prophyll tubular with tapering bifid tip, peduncular bracts 2-several, elongate, tubular, sheathing the peduncle, coriaceous or membranous, persistent, tips short, bifid, rachillae, long or short, slender or fleshy, sometimes ridged, lacking bracts at maturity, bearing closely appressed or rather widely spaced, spirally arranged staminate or pistillate flowers, rarely bearing curved acervuli of staminate flowers.
Some features of floral anatomy, including vascularisation of the ovule by a strand from each ventral bundle and abundant raphides in styles and stigmas, are characteristic of other genera in Chamaedoreeae and Ceroxyleae.
Germination adjacent-ligular, eophyll bifid or pinnate.
Staminate with peduncle 15-25 cm long, 5-8 mm wide at base and ± flattened, 5 mm diam.
Habit: solitary, erect or decumbent, to 2 m tall or more but sometimes flowering when stemless.
A small/medium sized palm to 2m tall with thin leaves, and coarsely veined pinnae.
Generally rather small, often clustering, pinnate-leaved dioecious palms from the undergrowth of rain forest from Mexico southwards to South America, very diverse and with a wide range of habits including one climbing species, inflorescence and flower form equally varied.
Flowers: Staminate in 8 dense spirals, contiguous in bud, 3.5 x 2.5 mm, ± ovoid, angled by mutual pressure, bright yellow, calyx prominent, 2 x 2.5 mm, scarcely lobed, whitish, sepals connate nearly to apex, forming a sheathing hyaline tube, ± straight apically, petals 3 x 2 mm, ovate, valvate, free in apical 1/2, spreading, rounded-acute, slightly erect, thickened, thicker distally, slightly grooved on inside, stamens 1.75 mm high, filaments thick, 1.5 x 0.5 mm, anthers in a close ring around pistillode, 1 x 0.5 mm, pistillode extending just above anthers, 2 x 0.5 mm, swollen basally.
Fruit small, globose or oblong, stigmatic remains basal, epicarp smooth, mesocarp fleshy, endocarp thin.
Staminate flowers symmetrical, sepals 3, entire, united basally or distinct, petals 3, distinct or variously connate, lobes valvate, stamens 6, filaments short, broad or awl-shaped, anthers dorsifixed, included, oblong or didymous, pistillode various, cylindric or expanded basally, sometimes trilobed.
Seed erect, globose, or ellipsoidal, hilum small, basal, branches of raphe obscure, endosperm cartilaginous, embryo basal to subapical.
The leaves are pinnate , with one to numerous leaflets.
General Information Erect, 2 m. tall: leaves uniformly pinnate, blade 60-70 cm.
Mostly Pinnate.
Stem usually slender, covered wholly or partially in fibrous leaf bases or smooth, green, prominently ringed with leaf scars.
Chamaedorea is a dioecious genus with male and female flowers occuring on separate plants.
Leaves bifid or variously pinnate, very rarely entire, reduplicate, sheath closed or becoming split, short or elongate, sometimes with a marcescent lobe opposite the petiole, petiole short to elongate, flattened adaxially, rounded abaxially, sometimes with a prominent pale green or yellow, abaxial stripe, rachis rounded, angled, or flattened adaxially, rounded abaxially, blade entire, bifid and pinnately ribbed, or regularly or irregularly pinnately divided, leaflets few or many, of 1 or several folds, narrow or broad, often oblique or sigmoid, acuminate, surfaces glabrous.
Stem: 1.5-2 cm diam., green, smooth, conspicuously ringed, internodes 3-10 cm long.
Flowers sessile or partly enclosed in a cavity in the fleshy rachilla, small or minute.
Small, sometimes moderate, erect or procumbent, rarely climbing, acaulescent or trunked, solitary or clustered, unarmed, pleonanthic, dioecious palms.
Subshrub, Solitary palm.
Leaves: 4-6, spreading, pinnate but sometimes flowering when bifid or variously pinnate, sheath 25 cm long, tubular in basal '/2, white-margined apically transitioning to dark basally, longitudinally striate-nerved, petiole 25-35 cm long, 5-7 mm thick, lightly grooved and green above, rounded and with a light green band below, rachis 30-45 cm long or more, obtusely angled and green above, rounded with a light green band below extending onto sheath, blade 60-70 cm long, firm textured, glossy, pinnae 7-9 per side, 25-30 x 3-6 cm, narrowly lanceolate, slightly sigmoid or falcate, acute-acuminate, drooping at tip, ± narrowed basally, subopposite or alternate, regularly placed, 8-10 nerved, these light-colored and pronounced below, end pair of pinnae wider, if blade bifid then to 50 x 30 cm, rachis to 30 cm long, lobes to 25 cm long, 50 prominent nerves on each side of rachis.
They are small palms, growing to 0.3-6 m tall with slender, cane-like stems, growing in the understory in rainforests , and often spreading by means of underground runners , forming clonal colonies.

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

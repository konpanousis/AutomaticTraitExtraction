We are interested in obtaining botanical trait information about the species Oenocarpus balickii.

We will provide an input text with botanical descriptions,followed by a dictionary where each key 'name' represents a trait name, referring to specific organ or other element of the plant, and is associated to a list with all possible trait values for that trait, ['value_1', 'value_2', ..., 'value_n'].

Input text:
Seed ovoid-ellipsoidal to globose, hilum basal, raphe lateral, branches parallel, indistinct, endosperm homogeneous and striate, or ruminate, with central cavity, embryo basal, very large, extending through the endosperm into central cavity.
Leaf ragged 112-120 pairs of pinnae in groups of 2-6, in different directions, regularly disposed in one plane in the 30 cm toward the apex, shealth 41 cm long 30 cm in diameter, petiole 0-5 cm, rachis 306-333 cm long, median pinna 55-64.5 cm long x 2.9-3.5 cm wide.
Oenocarpus balickii is a single-stemmed palm, usually growing 7 - 14 metres tall with some specimens to 20 metres.
Individuals can grow to 14 m.

Solitary palm, trunk 10.32 m long, 8 cm in diameter.
Definition: whole plant herbaceous.
Stem erect, densely covered in fibrous leaf sheaths, when mature becoming bare except rarely fibrous network persistent, leaf scars smooth, flush with stem basally, swollen and prominent distally, a small mass of slender roots sometimes present basally.
Leaf ragged : 112-120 pairs of pinnae in groups of 2-6, in different directions, regularly disposed in one plane in the 30 cm toward the aprex, sheath 41 cm l.
The pataux¡ , it differs by noticeably inferior size and leaves with pinnae irregular and pointed in different directions - in pataux¡ the pinas are regularly arranged along the sheet, forming a single plane.
Moderate to very large, solitary or clustered pinnate-leaved palms from Central and South America, with distinctive inflorescences in the form of a horse-s tail.
Definition: whole plant arborescent.
Pistillate flowers shorter than the staminate, sepals 3, distinct, suborbicular, imbricate, hooded, petals 3, distinct, imbricate except for valvate apices when young, otherwise like the sepals, staminodes tooth-like or lacking, gynoecium ovoid, briefly stalked, unilocular, uniovulate, style short, cylindrical, bearing 3 fleshy stigmas, reflexed at anthesis, papillose adaxially.
Moderate to massive, solitary or clustered, unarmed , pleonanthic, monoecious palms.
Fruit ellipsoidal to globose, dark purple when ripe, perianth persistent, stigmatic remains apical to slightly eccentric, epicarp smooth or minutely pebbled, waxy, mesocarp fleshy, oily, with internal fibres adnate to and covering the seed, endocarp apparently lacking.
Pollen ellipsoidal, occasionally oblate triangular, with slight or obvious asymmetry, aperture a distal sulcus, occasionally, a trichotomosulcus, ectexine tectate, finely or coarsely perforate-rugulate, aperture margin finer, infratectum columellate, longest axis 38-56 µm.

Initial dictionary of traits with all possible values:
{"Fruit colour description": ['black', 'blue', 'bluish', 'brown', 'brownish', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'darkgreen', 'green', 'greenish', 'grey', 'ivory', 'magenta', 'maroon', 'olive', 'orange', 'orangish', 'pink', 'pinkish', 'plum', 'purple', 'purplish', 'red', 'reddish', 'tan', 'violet', 'white', 'whitish', 'yellow', 'yellowish'], "Fruit colour": ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'ivory', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'], "Crown": ['both', 'canopy', 'understorey'], "Fruit size": ['large', 'small'], "Fruit shape": ['ellipsoid', 'elongate', 'fusiform', 'globose', 'ovoid', 'pyramidal', 'rounded'], "Conspicuousness": ['conspicuous', 'cryptic']}

Turn each string s in the list of values in the dictionary into a sublist (s,b), where b is a binary number,either 0 or 1, indicating whether there is strong evidence for value s in the input text. Double check that 'value_i' is reported referring to trait 'name' in the text, and not to a different trait. Always set 'b' to '0' if you are not 100% sure about the association. Do not add new trait values and do not modify the initial ones.Return the dictionary of traits and sublists of (value, evidence) containing ALL POSSIBLE NAMES AND (values, evidence) tuples.

Output only a dictionary in JSON format, no other text at all.

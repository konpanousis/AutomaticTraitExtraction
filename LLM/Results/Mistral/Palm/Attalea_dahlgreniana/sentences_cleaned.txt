Typical A. butyracea has small fruits, turning yellow at maturity, with inconspicuous endocarp fibers, and with two seeds , leaf segments are stiff, glossy green adaxially and waxy-glaucous abaxially.
Attalea rostrata complex Attalea osmantha , A. rostrata This Caribbean-Central American group seems distinct from the western South-American A. butyracea complex, especially in having petiolate leaves.
Palms referred to as Orbignya are characterized by stamens with coiled anthers, and staminate flowers often densely packed on rachillae.
Life forms of Attalea species vary from small acaulescent palms to tall and massive palms, always solitary.
The newly described A. moorei is particularly noteworthy for the very regular arrangement of pinnae, spreading in one plane, a feature not shared with the other members of the group.
At the seedling stage, Attalea sensu lato species are recognizable by the lanceolate eophylls with dentate upper margins and latter by the asymmetrical pinna apex with a lateral projection, brownish on the abaxial side.
This group is defined by epetiolate leaves with very regularly arranged pinnae, these with a prominent spine-shaped auricle basally , peduncular bract thin, staminate flowers spirally arranged on staminate rachillae and dispersed fibers within a thin endocarp.
